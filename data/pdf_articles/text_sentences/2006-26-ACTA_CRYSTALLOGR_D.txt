D62, 589–594  The structures of the PDI-related protein Wind (with a C-terminal His6 tag) and the mutants Y53S, Y53F and Y55K have been determined and compared with the wild-type structure with the His6 tag at the N-terminus.
All five structures show the same mode of dimerization, showing that this was not an artefact introduced by the nearby N-terminal His6 tag and suggesting that this dimer may also be the biologically active form.
Although the mutants Y53S and Y55K completely abrogate transport of the protein Pipe (which appears to be the primary function of Wind in the cell), only subtle differences can be seen in the putative Pipebinding region.
The Pipe binding in the active forms appears to involve hydrophobic interactions between aromatic systems, whereas the inactive mutants may be able to bind more strongly with the help of hydrogen bonds, which could disturb the delicate equilibrium required for effective Pipe transport.

Introduction Wind, a product of the Windbeutel gene, is required for dorsoventral patterning in the developing embryo of Drosophila melanogaster along with two other gene products, Nudel (nudel) and Pipe (pipe), that constitute three of the 11 genes localized in the somatic follicle cells (Konsolaki & Schu¨pbach, 1997).
Wind is an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein and belongs to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) related protein subfamily (PDI-D).
PDIs are known for their varying redox and chaperone activities (Ferrari & So¨ling, 1999).
The PDI-D group of proteins is characterized by the presence of one or two N-terminal domains of about 100–120 residues in length called the thioredoxin domain (b-domain) followed by an all--helical C-terminal domain about 110 residues in length termed the D-domain (Ferrari & So¨ling, 1999).
Pipe is a Golgi-resident type-II transmembrane protein related to the vertebrate glycosaminoglycan-modifying enzyme heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase.
It has been shown recently that Wind is required for correct targeting of Pipe to Golgi (Sen et al., 2000), but the mechanism by which this process takes place is not yet understood.
The crystal structure of wild-type Wind has been described by Ma et al.
(2003); the asymmetric unit consists of a dimer, with the dimerization-contact surface along the N-terminal b-domain.
Based on this structure, a series of mutational studies have been carried out to map substrate-binding sites on the surface of Wind and a putative peptide-binding site in the Wind b-domain has been characterized with the help of in vitro binding assays (Barnewitz et al., 2004).

Though there was a solution for both the D-domains, the second D-domain had to be discarded because the B values were very high and there was no traceable electron density in this region during refinement.

All the structures show significant variations in the conformations of some side chains.
Compared with the other structures, the D-domain of Y55K exhibits an appreciably different orientation relative to the b-domain, with a rotation of about 45 around Gly145.
With such an orientation of the D-domain with respect to the b-domain, residue Cys149 in the linker region is closer to Tyr143, with a C—C distance between ˚ , compared with about 6.9 A ˚ in the wildthem of about 4.4 A type and other mutant structures.

The relevance, if any, of these observations with respect to a recent suggestion of a key structural role of Cys125 in rat ERp29 (homologous to Cys149 in Wind) in providing stability to the D-domain (Hermann et al., 2005) remains to be established.

The dimer interface  The Wind dimer is formed by a head-to-tail arrangement of b-domains with the participation of residues constituting the 1 strand and residues within and after the 1 and 2 helices, mediated through a variety of hydrophobic and hydrogenbonding interactions shown in Table 3.
The partially conserved residues Gly26, Val28, Gln31 and Arg41 contribute to the dimer interface (Fig.

In wild-type Wind-His and all the mutants, the hydrogen-bonding distances in the region of the dimer interface agree within experimental error with those in His-Wind.

Substrate-binding site and hydrophobic molecular-interaction surface  The substrate-binding site of the b-domain containing the Tyr53, Tyr55 and Tyr86 residues was examined for possible structural differences amongst the mutants Y53S, Y53F and Y55K.
This Figure 4 region is close to the pseudo-twofold (a) Intact disulfide bond in Wind-His (His-Wind, Y53S and Y55K are similar) and (b) the open axis of the dimer, so it is possible that disulfide bridge in Y53F, which is accompanied by an approximately 180 rotation about (Thr25).
the sites in the two monomers combine to make a single Pipe-binding site.
The mutants Y53S and Y53F are conformationally very similar, but in Y55K the lysine side chain points upwards 90 away from the plane of the tyrosine ring (Fig.
5).
It is possible that this results in a tighter association of the substrate (Pipe) with the Wind dimer, leading to a stronger complex, accounting for the observation in in vivo assays with the Wind-Y55K mutant and Pipe that Pipe translocation from Golgi was abrogated.
To analyse the hypothesis that the Wind–Pipe interaction is predominantly hydrophobic, involving aromatic interactions, the relative hydrophobic potentials on the surface shown in Fig.
6 were estimated using a DRY (hydrophobic) probe in the program GRID (Goodford, 1985).
The net charge on each of the dimers as calculated using GRIN (Goodford, 1985) are 7.38, 9.05, 11.23 and 13.21 for Wind-His, Y53F, Y53S and Y55K, respectively: the two inactive mutants are appreFigure 5 ciably more polar.

3.
Wind does not interfere with dimerization.
The 1 angle of Val28 is not conserved in the mutant structure Y53F; this could be because of the changes in oxidation state of the Cys pair, which might further affect the dimerization surface and possibly the monomer/dimer ratio.
In solution, Wind is present partly as a monomer but mainly as a dimer.

Opening of the CTGC loop in Y53F  In the crystal structure of Y53F, the CTGC loop in both monomers has lost its disulfide bond, as shown in Fig.

As a result of a change of approximately 180 in (Thr25), Cys27 is ˚ from the carboxyl O atom of Glu32.

Crystal-packing interactions in Y55K and Wind-His  Y55K crystallized at a different pH and in a different space group to all the other mutants and attempts to crystallize Y55K at the pH of the wild-type crystallization conditions failed, although there is no difference in dimerization mode and in the secondary structure of the b-domains.
In Y55K, Tyr53 of one of the b-domains forms a hydrogen bond with Arg218 and the second Tyr53 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr44 of a symmetry-equivalent molecule.
One of the Lys55 residues forms a hydrogen bond with Ser137 of a symmetryequivalent molecule and the second Lys55 is involved in a hydrophobic interaction with a symmetry-equivalent Phe42.
In wild-type Wind-His, except for one tyrosine (Tyr55) that forms a hydrogen bond with symmetry-equivalent Arg237, all other tyrosines are involved in hydrophobic interactions.
These interactions may give an indication of the differences in the substrate binding of Y55K, which has been shown to bind much more strongly than wild-type Wind-His to Pipe or to peptides derived from fragments of the Pipe sequence (Barnewitz et al., 2004).

Conclusions Although the mutants Y53S and Y55K completely abrogate Pipe transport, the structural differences in the binding regions between these two mutants and the functional Y53F mutant and wild-type Wind protein in the Pipe-binding region are subtle, despite a large difference in the orientation of the b-domain and D-domain to one another in the Y55K mutant.
The interactions with symmetry-equivalent molecules suggest that Y53S and Y55K may bind more strongly to Pipe, disturbing the delicate equilibrium based on predominantly hydrophobic interactions necessary for Pipe transport.
The very similar structures observed for His-Wind and Wind-His indicate that the N-terminal His6 tag, although close to the  594  Sevvana et al.
