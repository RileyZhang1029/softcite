1  Supplementary Methods The cavity under the vertex is roughly cylindrical, having a radius of ~25Å and depth ~30Å (Fig.
3b).
The P16 polypeptide chain becomes disordered after residue 56, and if this cavity had to accommodate the remaining 300 P16 residues (5 copies of 60 residues from the symmetry related P16 molecules around the vertex), the Matthews Coefficient Vm for the cavity would be 1.8Å3/Da.
Furthermore, since Fragment II is too small to be an entire protein, the cavity would also have to accommodate the disordered amino acids from the protein of which fragment II forms a part.
This would give Vm < 1.8 Å3/Da, corresponding to the maximum possible packing density for proteins.
This scenario seems unlikely given that the cavity appears quite empty in the electron density maps.
We believe that fragment II is the P16 C-terminus, since then the cavity would only accommodate 5 loops of ~37 residues, giving Vm ~ 2.9Å3/Da, with no additional protein in the cavity being necessary to account for the observed electron density.
