Life extension through neurofibromin mitochondrial
regulation and antioxidant therapy for
neurofibromatosis-1 in Drosophila melanogaster
James Jiayuan Tong1,2, Samuel E Schriner1, David McCleary1, Brian J Day3 & Douglas C Wallace1
We investigated the pathophysiology of neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) in Drosophila melanogaster by inactivation or overexpression
of the NF1 gene. NF1 gene mutants had shortened life spans and increased vulnerability to heat and oxidative stress in association
with reduced mitochondrial respiration and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Flies overexpressing NF1 had
increased life spans, improved reproductive fitness, increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress in association with increased
mitochondrial respiration and a 60% reduction in ROS production. These phenotypic effects proved to be modulated by the
adenylyl cyclase/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A pathway, not the Ras/Raf pathway. Treatment of wild-type D. melanogaster
with cAMP analogs increased their life span, and treatment of NF1 mutants with metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidant
compounds restored their life span. Thus, neurofibromin regulates longevity and stress resistance through cAMP regulation of
mitochondrial respiration and ROS production, and NF1 may be treatable using catalytic antioxidants.

NF1 is one of the most common neurogenetic diseases, with a
prevalence of 1 in 3,000 worldwide1–3. More than 10% of humans
harboring mutations in NF1 gene develop malignant tumors early in
life1,2, and the life expectancy of individuals with NF1 is reduced by at
least 10 to 15 years1–3. In addition to cafe´-au-lait spots and neurofibromas, NF1 manifestations include learning disabilities and
developmental abnormalities4–8.
Neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene, is a tumor
suppressor, and its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain negatively regulates Ras activity; when NF1 function is compromised, Ras
becomes hyperactive. Neurofibromin also positively regulates the
G protein–stimulated and Ca2+/calmodulin–sensitive adenylyl cyclase
in both D. melanogaster and mice2. Consequently, inactivation of NF1
results in upregulation of the Ras/Raf pathway9 and downregulation of
adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling6–8.
Most studies on the pathophysiology NF1 have focused on the
Ras/Raf pathway2,4,5 because of its well-established role in tumorigenesis9. However, recent research has demonstrated the importance of
neurofibromin regulation of adenylyl cyclase, cAMP and PKA activity
in the etiology of impaired learning and related electrophysiological
abnormalities in D. melanogaster NF1 mutants6–8,10.
Here we report extensive studies on both the inactivation and the
overexpression of the NF1 gene in D. melanogaster, demonstrating that
neurofibromin deficiency shortens life span and increases sensitivity to
oxidative stress, whereas increased neurofibromin extends life span
and improves resistance to oxidative and thermal stress. We show that

these phenotypes are mediated by modulation of the adenylyl cyclase/
cAMP/PKA pathway and are associated with changes in mitochondrial
NADH-linked respiration and ROS production. Finally, we establish a
causal role for cAMP and mitochondrial ROS production in determining life span, demonstrating that cAMP analogs can extend life
spans of wild-type flies and that catalytic antioxidant drugs can
ameliorate the life reduction of the NF1 mutants.
RESULTS
Phenotype and pathophysiology of NF1 mutant flies
We generated two homozygous NF1 mutants (designated NF1P1 and
NF1P2) via P element mutagenesis and tested them for their longevity.
To control for genetic background effects, the NF1P1 and NF1P2 strains
were backcrossed five generations to the w1118 (isoCJ1) strain to
generate approximately 97% isogenic strains7 (Methods).
The NF1P1 mutant strain had a 60%–73% reduction in life span,
and the NF1P2 mutant strain had a 24%–40% reduction in life span,
relative to the isogenic K33 control strain (Fig. 1a). The NF1P1/P2
intercross heterozygotes had a life span similar to the NF1P2 flies
(Fig. 1a,b). The greater life reduction caused by the NF1P1 mutation
might reflect the disruption of additional functional genes within an
intron of NF1. The diminished life span of the NF1P2 mutants was
rescued by the introduction into these flies of an NF1 transgene
(hsNF1) integrated into the 2nd chromosome and driven by the heat
shock gene promoter (Fig. 1a). hsNF1 transgene expression increases
in a temperature- and time-dependent manner6.

To determine if the reduced life span was due to the upregulation of
the Ras/Raf pathway or the downregulation of the adenylyl cyclase/
cAMP/PKA pathway, we tested life spans of flies harboring mutations
specifically affecting these pathways. We upregulated the Ras/Raf
pathway by introducing RasV12 and Raf* M7 transgenes, both under
heat shock promoter regulation, into flies maintained at 25 1C
(refs. 4,5). Both hsRasV12/+;K33 and hsRaf*M7/+;K33 flies had normal
life spans (Fig. 1c). Thus, upregulation of Ras/Raf signaling did not
shorten NF1 mutant life spans.
To test if the short life was due to the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA
pathway downregulation, we analyzed mutant alleles of the neurofibromin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, designated rutabaga (rut)6,11.
Two different rutabaga mutants, rut1 and rut2080, had significantly
shortened life spans, and the rut and NF1 double mutant (rut;NF1P2)
did not further shorten the life span (Fig. 1b,c), implicating cAMP in
mediating longevity. To confirm that the reduced life span in NF1P2
was the product of reduced cAMP levels, we combined the NF1P2
allele with a cAMP phosphodiesterase gene mutation, dunce (dnc1),
which inhibits cAMP degradation10,11. The life span of the dnc;NF1P2
flies was restored to normal (Fig. 1c). Normal life was also restored in
hsPKA/+;NF1P2 flies when NF1P2 was combined with the heat shock–
inducible and constitutively active PKA (hsPKA*), which upregulates
protein phosphorylation6 (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the reduced life span
of the NF1 mutants is the product of the impairment of adenylyl
cyclase/cAMP/PKA signaling.
To determine the effect of NF1 mutations on D. melanogaster
physical fitness, we exploited the observation that NF1 mutants
showed an inhibited escape response8. To quantify this phenotype,

we startled flies in a vial by tapping them down to the bottom of the
vial and then measuring their up-climbing capacity before, during and
after a 20-min 37 1C heat stress (Fig. 1d). The percentage of flies that
climbed up 10 mm in 15 s was defined as the locomotive index, and
the time necessary the for locomotive index to reach above 90% was
defined as the recovery time (t) (Fig. 1e). NF1P1, NF1P2 and NF1P1/P2
flies required over 100 min to recover from the heat stress, compared
with 30 min for the K33 control. The reduced heat tolerance of the
NF1 mutants was not due to the overexpression of the Ras/Raf
pathway, as hsRaf* M7/+;K33 and hsRasV12/+;K33 flies showed t values
similar to control K33 flies (Fig. 1e). On the other hand, rut and
rut;NF1P2 flies had the same delayed recovery time as the NF1P1/P2
mutant flies (Fig. 1e). Moreover, when NF1P2 was combined with
hsPKA* (to give hsPKA*;NF1P2 flies) or dnc (dnc;NF1P2), t returned to
the normal range (Fig. 1e). Thus, the reduced tolerance of the NF1
flies to heat stress must also be the product of the adenylyl cyclase/
cAMP/PKA pathway downregulation.
To further investigate the fitness of NF1 mutants, we tested their
tolerance to desiccation and oxidative stress. NF1P2 flies proved to be
as resistant to desiccation as K33 controls (Supplementary Fig. 1
online), but NF1P2, rut and rut;NF1P2 flies were all significantly more
sensitive to paraquat-induced oxidative stress than controls (Fig. 2a).
Paraquat generates intracellular superoxide anion (O2–) through
redox cycling12. The paraquat sensitivity of NF1P2 flies was eliminated
in hsNF1/+;NF1P2 flies (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, neurofibromin overexpression on a wild-type background (hsNF1/+;K33) or PKA overexpression on NF1 mutant background (hsPKA*/+;NF1P2) greatly
increased resistance to paraquat-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 2a).

As the mitochondria are a major source of endogenous ROS13,
and increased ROS could sensitize cells to paraquat, we assayed
mitochondrial aconitase activity. The relative specific activity of
aconitase is an effective indicator of endogenous mitochondrial
oxidative stress, as the aconitase iron-sulfur center is particularly
prone to superoxide anion inactivation14,15. In 30-d-old flies,
mitochondrial aconitase activities were reduced by 36% in NF1P2
flies, 75% in rut flies and 76% in the double mutant rut;NF1P2 flies,
relative to age-matched controls (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, aconitase
activity was restored by the hsNF1 transgene (hsNF1;NF1P2) and
was increased more than 90% when neurofibromin was overexpressed
on a wild-type background (hsNF1/+;K33) or when the constitutive
PKA was overexpressed even in the absence of NF1 (hsPKA*;NF1P2)
(Fig. 2a). We confirmed that aconitase activity reductions were due
to the inactivation of existing aconitase instead of reduced expression
of the enzyme, because dithiothreitol and iron reactivated the
enzymatic activities to the same degree in both mutant and
control flies (Fig. 2b). Thus, inactivation of the NF1 gene increased
oxidative stress, mediated by downregulation of adenylyl cyclase/
cAMP/PKA.

As inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain can
increase ROS, we analyzed respiration rates of NF1 mutant mitochondria versus control mitochondria during metabolism of the NADHlinked complex I substrates pyruvate and malate. The ADP-stimulated
(state III) respiration rate (Supplementary Fig. 2 online) and the
derived ATP synthesis rate (Fig. 2a) were reduced by approximately
50% in NF1P1, NF1P2, rut and rut;NF1P2 flies, whereas the non–ADPstimulated (state IV) respiration was unaffected (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Addition of the heat shock–inducible neurofibromin gene
(hsNF1/+;NF1P2) or PKA overexpression (hsPKA*/+;NF1P2) restored
the state III respiration rate (Supplementary Fig. 2) and predicted
ATP synthesis rates (Fig. 2a) to normal levels.
The NF1 mutant mitochondria were then tested for ROS production. Using the MitoSOX fluorescent indicator to monitor superoxide anion production that is a result of the direct transfer of an
electron from the electron transport chain to O2 to generate O2–13, we
found that NF1P1/P2 mitochondria generated more superoxide than
control mitochondria (Fig. 2c). Superoxide levels were increased in
rut and rut;NF1P2 flies but were reduced to control levels by introduction of the hsNF1 transgene (hsNF1;NF1P2) (Fig. 2d). Again,

Phenotype and physiology of NF1-overexpressing flies
To further validate the importance of the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA
pathway and its effects on mitochondrial respiration and ROS
production in regulating life span, stress resistance and fecundity,
we generated flies that overexpressed neurofibromin by introducing an
extra copy of the NF1 gene, for a total of three copies. We used two
different strategies to overexpress neurofibromin: (i) introduction
of the heat shock–inducible NF1 transgene (hsNF1) into wild-type
K33 flies and maintenance of the flies at 25 1C and (ii) combining

a transgene in which the UAS cis element was fused to the
D. melanogaster NF1 gene (UAS-dNF1) with a transgene in which
the GAL4 enhancer was driven via either the systemic (Armadillo
(Arm))8 or neuron-specific (ELAV) promoters (Arm-GAL4 and ELAVGAL4, respectively).
Upregulation of NF1 gene expression by maintaining hsNF1/+;K33
flies at 25 1C throughout life resulted in higher levels of neurofibromin
(Supplementary Fig. 4 online), an increase in mean life span of 49%
for male flies and 68% for females and an increase in maximum life
span of 38% for males and 52% for females (Fig. 3a,b). By contrast,
when we maintained hsNF1/+;K33 flies at 25 1C through embryogenesis and 4 d into adulthood but then switched them to 18 1C for the
remainder of their adult life, the amount of neurofibromin fell to
near-control levels, the extension of maximum life span was eliminated and the extension of mean life span was minimized (Supplementary Fig. 4). The residual increased neurofibromin observed in
the 18 1C adults was probably carried over from the prior period when
the flies were maintained at 25 1C.
We plotted age-specific mortality curves of hsNF1/+;K33 and K33
flies on a natural log scale (Fig. 3c,d) and estimated the Gompertz
parameters (Supplementary Table 1 online). This showed that the
mortality rates of the hsNF1/+;K33 and K33 flies were similar, but
their intercepts differed by a factor of 2 to 3. Therefore, neurofibromin
overexpression reduces the baseline mortality without altering the agedependent mortality rate.
We also overexpressed neurofibromin using the GAL4-UAS system7.
We studied two independent UAS-dNF1 transgenic lines after
outcrossing all transgenic lines five generations to w1118 to generate
an isogenic background. When we crossed the UAS-dNF1 lines with
Arm-GAL4 flies to generate double heterozygous animals (Arm-GAL4/
+;UAS-dNF1/+), the resulting neurofibromin-overexpressing flies
(Supplementary Fig. 4) showed a mean life span increase of
74% in males and 81% in females and an increase in maximal life
span of 65% in males and 70% in females, relative to the homozygous
Arm-GAL4 or UAS-dNF1 or heterozygous Arm-GAL4 /+ and

overexpression of Ras (hsRasV12/+;K33) or Raf (hsRaf M7/+;K33) did
not affect superoxide production (Fig. 2d), ruling out a role for the
Ras/Raf pathway.
The increased superoxide anion production of NF1P1/P2 flies could
result from either increased generation of superoxide anion or
decreased scavenging by manganese superoxide dismutase
(MnSOD). However, analysis of total SOD, MnSOD and catalase
activities from NF1P2 and K33 flies did not show any significant
differences in enzyme activities (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). Therefore, the elevated superoxide generated by NF1 mutant flies seems to
be the result of increased production, not reduced scavenging.
To further verify that increased superoxide anion production was
the cause of the reduced NF1P1/P2 life span, we fed NF1P1/P2 flies with
the metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidants Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic
acid) porphrin (MnTBAP)16 and tetrakis(1,3-diethyl imidazolium2-yl) meso-substituted manganoporphyrin (MnTDEIP)17, both of
which have broad-spectrum antioxidant activities, including SOD
activity18,19. MnTBAP and MnTDEIP exposure increased the survivorship of NF1P1/P2 flies by approximately 50% (Fig. 2e,f). These
drugs also enhanced the recovery rate of locomotive performance of
NF1P1/P2 mutants after heat stress (Fig. 2g). Therefore, the reduced
life span and reduced stress resistance of NF1P1/P2 and NF1P2 flies,
associated with reduced cAMP and mitochondrial respiration, is
a direct consequence of increased mitochondrial superoxide
anion production.

Figure 3 Life extension in flies by overexpression of NF1. (a–d) NF1 overexpression using the heat shock promoter. a and b show hsNF1/+;K33 versus K33
flies at 25 1C (log-rank test: P o 0.0001 for males and females; seven or eight experiments with 40 flies each; total of 280 or 320 flies per category).
c and d show age-specific mortality rates of hsNF1/+;K33 and K33 flies plotted on a natural log scale versus time, fit by Gompertz model (ln(mx) ¼ ln(m0) +
ax ), where mx ¼ mortality rate at age x, m0 ¼ baseline mortality (intercept as ln(m0)) and a ¼ change of mortality with age (slope of the trajectory). Values
are given in Table 1. (e,f) NF1 overexpression using the GAL4 -UAS system. Offspring from the crosses between homozygous Armadillo-GAL4 and two
independent homozygous UAS-D. melanogaster NF1 transgenic lines yield double heterozygous flies (Arm-GAL4/UAS-dNF1), compared with individual
transgene heterozygotes (Arm-GAL4/+ and UAS-dNF1/+ ). Results of log-rank test are shown (P o 0.0001 for both males and females, six experiments

increase in survival time and the males a 51% increase in
survival time during paraquat exposure, relative to K33 controls
(Fig. 4e,f). However, hsNF1/+;K33 flies were not more resistant to
desiccation (Fig. 4g,h).
The life span extension of the neurofibromin-overexpressing flies
was not due to the downregulation of the Ras/Raf pathway, as flies
heterozygous for two different Ras mutants (Rase2F/+ or Rase1B/+)
(homozygotes being lethal) had normal life spans (data not shown).
On the other hand, the life span extension could be accounted for
by the upregulation of the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA pathway.
The cAMP concentrations were elevated approximately twofold in
NF1-overexpressing hsNF1/+;K33 and Arm-GAL4/+;UAS-dNF/+
strains, relative to K33 or Arm-GAL4/+ of USA-dNF1/+ controls
(Supplementary Fig. 6 online). Moreover, feeding w1118 flies the
cell-permeable cAMP analogs dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) and
8-bromo-cAMP increased life span. Adult males that were fed 1 mM
or 10 mM db-cAMP showed a 30% increase in median life span,
females that were fed 1 mM db-cAMP showed a 60% increase in life
span and females fed 10 mM db-cAMP showed a 4100% increase in
life span (Fig. 5a,b). We obtained similar findings by 8-bromo-cAMP
feeding (Fig. 5c,d). This life span extension was unlikely to be due to
calorie restriction, as the body weights of both males and females
remained the same as controls (Supplementary Fig. 6).
As a further demonstration of the importance of increased cAMP in
life extension, cAMP phosphodiesterase-deficient dunce mutants
lived significantly longer than their control Canton S counterparts
(Fig. 5e,f). Similarly, PKA-overexpressing flies (hsPKA*/+ flies at
25 1C) also had extended life spans (Fig. 5g,h). Thus, the increased
life span of the NF1-overexpressing flies can be recapitulated by the
adenylyl cyclase/cAMP/PKA activation.
In many systems, life span extension is associated with inactivation
of the insulin-like growth factor receptor-protein kinase B (Akt1/2

UAS-dNF1/+ parental strains (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Table 1).
Thus, we were able to extend D. melanogaster life span using
two different genetic strategies to increase neurofibromin levels,
involving three independent inserts of the NF1 transgene. Therefore,
the life span extension must be a product of neurofibromin
overexpression and not simply a consequence of heat shock or
chromosomal position effects.
To determine the proportion of the life span extension that was due
to neurofibromin protection of neurons20,21, we combined the UASdNF1 transgene with the neuron-specific ELAV promoter (ELAVGAL4). Both male and female ELAV-GAL4/+;UAS-dNF1/+ flies also
showed a life span extension of approximately 50% (Supplementary
Fig. 5 online). Thus, maintaining neuronal integrity must be an
important component of longevity.
The increased life span of NF1-overexpressing D. melanogaster
suggests that they may also be more physically robust. To determine
if this was true, we analyzed the reproductive fertility (Fig. 4a) and
fecundity (data not shown) of the hsNF1/+;K33 females and found
that both fertility and fecundity were higher in the NF1-overexpressing
flies than in controls. This was not because the NF1-overexpressing
flies were bigger, as both hsNF1/+;K33 males and females had similar
body lengths as K33 males and females, respectively (Fig. 4b,c).
Although the hsNF1/+;K33 females were slightly heavier than K33
females (Fig. 4b,c) this could be because they carried more eggs. Thus,
contrary to prevailing evolutionary theories that predict that longevity
is inversely correlated with reproductive capacity22, neurofibromin
overexpression increased both longevity and fertility.
We tested the stress resistance of NF1-overexpressing flies by
assessing up-climbing ability and found that the hsNF1/+;K33
flies were highly resistant to heat stress (Fig. 4d). Similarly, the
NF1-overexpressing flies were highly resistant to paraquat-induced
oxidative stress, with the hsNF1/+;K33 females showing a 56%

As NF1 inactivation decreased mitochondrial respiration and
increased ROS production, we predicted that increased neurofibromin
would have the opposite effects. Indeed, mitochondrial NADH-linked

respiration), but not in the absence of ADP (state IV respiration)
(Fig. 6a and Table 1). Consequently, the respiratory control
ratio (RCR) (state III O2 consumption rate/state IV O2 consumption
rate) was significantly higher for mitochondria from NF1-overexpressing flies (hsNF1/+;K33) than for K33 mitochondria (4.8 versus
3.4, n ¼ 6, P ¼ 0.02, t test) (Fig. 6a) and for Arm-GAL4/UAS-dNF1
mitochondria versus control Arm-GAL4/+ or UAS-dNF1 mitochondria (5.3 versus 3.6, n ¼ 5, P ¼ 0.008, t test) (Table 1). As the
OXPHOS coupling efficiency (P/O ratio) was not changed
(Fig. 6b), we can calculate that the NF1-overexpressing (hsNF1/
+;K33) mitochondria have a 54% higher ATP production rate,
when metabolizing NADH-linked substrates, than K33 control
mitochondria (Fig. 2a), which parallels an increase in complex I
activity (Fig. 6c).
By contrast, the respiration rates we recorded when using the
FADH2-linked complex II substrate succinate were essentially the
same for neurofibromin-overexpressing mitochondria (hsNF1/+;
K33) versus control K33 mitochondria (Fig. 6d) and for Arm-GAL4/
UAS-dNF1 versus Arm-GAL4/+ or UAS-dNF1 mitochondria
(Table 1), with or without ADP. Thus, the succinate-based RCR
for hsNF1/+;K33 versus K33 mitochondria (1.9 versus 2.3 (n ¼ 4,
P ¼ 0.26, t test)) and for Arm-GAL4/UAS-dNF1 versus Arm-GAL4/+
or UAS-dNF1 mitochondria (2.6 versus 2.5 (P ¼ 0.49, t test)) were not
significantly different, and the P/O ratios were also unchanged (Fig. 6e
and Table 1).
The NADH-linked and FADH2-linked respiration pathways share
the downstream respiratory complexes III, IV and V, differing only in
the initial enzyme complex (complex I for the NADH-linked sub-

482

strates and complex II for succinate). Thus, the differences in respiration rate observed between NF1-overexpressing and control mitochondria are most likely to reside with complex I. This proved to be
the case, as complex I activity was 28% higher in NF1-overexpressing
hsNF1/+;K33 versus K33 mitochondria (Fig. 6c) and 38% higher in
Arm-GAL4/UAS-dNF1 versus Arm-GAL4/+ or UAS-dNF1 mitochondria (Table 1). Mitochondrial citrate synthase specific activity did
not differ between NF1-overexpressing and control mitochondria
(Fig. 6f and Table 1). Thus, the increased cAMP levels associated
with increased neurofibromin resulted in increased mitochondrial
complex I activity.
Increased neurofibromin levels could also be expected to result in
reduced mitochondrial ROS production. As expected, mitochondrial
H2O2 production was reduced 58%–59% for both hsNF1/+;K33
versus K33 flies (Fig. 6g) and Arm-GAL4/UAS-dNF1 versus ArmGAL4/+ or UAS-dNF1 flies (Table 1). This reduced mitochondrial
ROS was also associated with increased mitochondrial aconitase
activity throughout life, as demonstrated in hsNF1/+;K33 flies at 5,
20, and 40 d of adult age (Fig. 6h) and also for Arm-GAL4/UAS-dNF1
fly mitochondria (Table 1). These differences in mitochondrial
aconitase-specific activity were due to ROS modulation of the
enzyme-specific activity, as both NF1-overexpressing and control fly
mitochondrial aconitase activities were reactivated up to the same
level by treatment with dithiothreitol plus iron (Fig. 6i). Therefore, the
increased longevity associated with NF1 overexpression is mediated by
increased cAMP, resulting in increased NADH-linked respiration and
complex I activity and decreased mitochondrial ROS production
and oxidative stress.

Figure 7 The mechanism of neurofibromin-regulated life span.
Neurofibromin regulates adenylyl cyclase (AC), which converts ATP to cAMP,
activating PKA. PKA then increases mitochondrial respiration, possibly by
phosphorylating complex I subunits, leading to an increase in ATP synthesis
and a reduction in mitochondrial ROS production. By increasing ATP
production and inhibiting ROS production, neurofibromin promotes longevity.
The genetic and pharmacological manipulations discussed in the text
influence the process in a positive (green arrows) or negative manner (red
arrows). cAMP might modulate mitochondrial energy production and ROS
generation (and thus life span) by regulating nuclear gene transcription as
well. Catalytic antioxidants MnTBAP and MnTDEIP increase life spans in
NF1 mutants by inhibiting a negative factor, ROS. Although D. melanogaster
data do not support the role of Ras in neurofibromin-regulated longevity,
further studies in mammalian models will be required to elucidate possible
connections (dashed lines). PDE, phosphodiesterase.

DISCUSSION
We have discovered that in D. melanogaster, mutational loss of NF1
reduces life span and stress tolerance, inhibits mitochondrial respiration and leads to increased mitochondrial ROS production. Conversely, increased NF1 expression markedly extends life span, significantly
improves oxidative stress resistance and reproductive fitness, activates
mitochondrial complex I and reduces mitochondrial ROS production
and oxidative damage. Moreover, treatment of D. melanogaster
with exogenous cAMP markedly increases longevity, whereas treatment of NF1 mutant D. melanogaster with catalytic antioxidants
ameliorates the associated reduction in life span. Therefore, at least
in D. melanogaster, a significant component of the reduced life span
and the other adverse effects of neurofibromin deficiency are mediated
by cAMP regulation of mitochondrial function (Fig. 7).
The importance of cellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress in
modulating D. melanogaster longevity has been actively investigated.
D. melanogaster life span extension has been reported in transgenic
flies that systemically overexpress MnSOD and copper/zinc super
oxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), the latter either alone or with catalase
throughout life23,24,25. D. melanogaster life span has also been extended
by overexpression of Cu/ZnSOD or MnSOD in motor neurons20,21.
Moreover, flies with reduced life span due to Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD
deficiency that are treated with the catalytic antioxidant EUK-8
(manganese N,N’-bis(salicyidene) ethylenediamine chloride) or with
mitochondrially targeted coenzyme Q (MitoQ) partially restored
normal life span, although treatment of wild-type flies with EUK-8
or MitoQ shortened their life spans26. Our data show that treatment
of short-lived NF1 mutant flies with MnTBAP restores normal life
span, and MnTBAP has been shown to reduce mitochondrial ROS
production and oxidative damage27,28. Moreover, NF1 overexpression
extends life span in association with reduced mitochondrial ROS
generation. Taken together, these results support a central role for
mitochondrial ROS in determining the life span of D. melanogaster

but also indicate that to achieve the optimal benefits of antioxidant
treatment, it is necessary to define not only the specific ROS to be
removed (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical), but
also the time during development, the cell type and the subcellular
compartment to be targeted for ROS reduction.
In multiple animal systems, life span extension has been achieved by
the inactivation of the insulin-like receptor signal transduction pathway. When activated by insulin-like ligands, this pathway activates the
Akt kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the forkhead transcription factors (FOXOs). Active forkhead transcription factors upregulate
MnSOD and the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor g coactivator (PGC-1a) gene. The promoter of the mammalian PGC-1a gene
encompasses three insulin response elements (IREs) that bind dephosphorylated and deacetylated FOXO transcription factors and one
cAMP response element (CRE) that binds to phosphorylated
CREB13,29. The PGC-1a protein, in turn, interacts with multiple
transcription factors to upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis. Although
inactivation of the insulin-like growth factor receptor pathway should
upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis and reduce mitochondrial ROS
production13, this is unlikely to explain the modulation of life spans in
our current studies, as MnSOD expression and FOXO phosphorylation
did not change in NF1 mutant and NF1-overexpressing flies.
However, we found clear evidence for linkage between cAMP levels
and the regulation of life span, mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial ROS production. According to existing literature, there are
two possible mechanisms by which cAMP levels could regulate
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation: (i) transcriptional regulation of nuclear DNA–encoded mitochondrial genes and/or (ii) direct
cAMP-activated PKA modification of complex I polypeptides. In
mammalian systems, cAMP upregulates the expression of nuclear
DNA–encoded mitochondrial genes through the activation of the
PGC-1a gene, presumably through PKA phosphorylation of CREB
and the binding of phosphorylated CREB to the CRE element in the
PGC-1a gene promoter. This pathway might be a factor in our
observations, as a PGC-1a homolog has recently been identified in
D. melanogaster that induces upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis
through FOXO transcription factors30, and in silico analysis of the
upstream sequences of the D. melanogaster PGC-1a gene (CG9809)
showed putative cAMP response elements. However, functional analysis will be required to determine if such a pathway is important to
the NF1 overexpression phenotype.
Alternatively, cAMP could regulate mitochondrial respiration and
ROS production by the direct activation of mitochondrial PKA and
the phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrially localized cAMP-activated PKA has been reported to mediate phosphorylation of the complex I subunits31 ESSS and MWFE32 and/or 42 kDa
and B14.5A33. This has been associated with increased complex I
Vmax, increased NADH+-linked but not FADH2-linked respiration
and suppression of mitochondrial ROS production without major
alterations in the mitochondrial or cellular antioxidant defense systems31,34–36. These observations parallel our findings in NF1 mutant
and NF1-overexpressing D. melanogaster, suggesting that neurofibromin could regulate mitochondrial respiration and ROS production
through direct cAMP and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins. However, the relative importance of nuclear
oxidative phosphorylation gene regulation and mitochondrial protein
modulation by neurofibromin regulation of cAMP levels still needs to
be clarified.
Regardless of the molecular mechanism, the neurofibromin modulation of mitochondrial respiration and ROS production via cAMP
signaling directly implicate the mitochondria in the pathophysiology

ARTICLES
of NF1. Consistent with this possibility, neurofibromas from individuals with NF1 have been found to acquire somatic mutations in the
mtDNA control region37. Both germline and somatic mtDNA mutations have been observed in prostate cancers38, and somatic mtDNA
mutations have been observed in a wide range of human tumors39.
Moreover, mtDNA mutations have been linked to prostate cancer and
associated with increased mitochondrial ROS production38, and ROS
has been shown to act as a potent mitogen40. Therefore, the increased
mitochondrial ROS production resulting from NF1 mutations could
be an important factor in the generation of neurofibromas. If so, then
the suppression of mitochondrial ROS production through the treatment with catalytic antioxidants such as MnTBAP and MnTDEIP may
provide a powerful new approach to treat NF1, as well as other cancers.
METHODS
Fly stocks. All fly stocks were raised at 25 1C and 40%–50% humidity. K33 is
the parental line upon which the NF1 mutant and transgenic lines were
generated and thus was used as the control. Strains were compared on the
w1118 (isoCJ1) isogenic background after backcrossing for five generations,
yielding a 97% genetic similarity in the flies. Heterozygous hsNF1/+;NF1P2,
hsPKA/+;NF1P2, hsRaf*M7/+;K33, hsRasV12/+;K33 and hsNF1/+;K33 flies were
studied to avoid any recessive effects resulting from the insertion site of the
transgenes. The hsPKA;K33 flies harbor a mouse PKA transgene, with His87Gln
and Trp196Arg substitutions that prevent interaction with the PKA regulatory
subunit6,7. GAL4 and UAS-D. melanogaster NF1 lines were also backcrossed to
w1118 background for five generations.
Longevity assay. Life spans were determined at 25 1C and 50% humidity with a
12-h light/dark cycle. Male and female flies were collected under brief CO2
anesthesia 2 to 3 d after eclosion, allowing time for mating. The number of
deceased flies was recorded every 2 to 3 d, when flies were transferred to fresh
cornmeal agar medium. Both Statview 5.0 and Prism GraphPad software were
used for survival data and mortality curves analysis. We analyzed survival
data by Kaplan-Meier analysis in Statview 5.0. The log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
test results are presented. Censored data were recorded and analyzed with
GraphPad software.
Reproductivity. Fecundity was defined as cumulative number of eggs laid per
fertilized female. Fertility was defined as the cumulative number of adult
progeny per fertilized female. Each experiment consisted of five females and five
males, mated in vials containing standard food and transferred daily at 25 1C.
The number of eggs laid in each vial were counted as a measure of fecundity,
and the vials were kept until eclosion of all the adult progeny to determine
fertility. The t test was employed for data analysis.
Stress resistance. Stress assays were performed on 2- to 3-d-old flies collected
overnight, with 40 flies per vial kept on regular food medium. Paraquat toxicity
was tested by starving flies in empty vials for 6 h at 25 1C and then placing them
in the vial with a filter paper saturated with 20 mM paraquat and 5% sucrose in
distilled water. The effect of desiccation was determined by placing the flies in
empty vials at 25 1C. In both cases, dead flies were counted every 2 h.
Physical activity. Locomotive assays were performed on 3- to 4-d-old flies.
Flies were placed in 90 mm  20 mm vertical tubes containing a small quantity
of cornmeal food at the bottom with a line drawn horizontally 10 mm from the
base. Every 5 min, the vials were tapped until the flies were at the bottom of the
vials. Then, flies were given 15 s to climb (up-climbing behavior) toward the
top of the vial, and the numbers of flies above the 10 mm line were recorded.
The locomotive index is the percentage of flies that climbed up after 15 s. After
30 min of baseline recording at 22 1C, flies were subjected to a brief 20-min
heat treatment at 37 1C and were then returned to 22 1C for recovery. The
locomotive index was then plotted against time over the course of the
experiment to determine the recovery time (t).
cAMP feeding. cAMP-supplemented food was prepared using dibutyryl-cAMP
and 8-bromo-cAMP (Sigma) dissolved in distilled water to prepare a stock
solution. The stock solutions were subsequently diluted into food to make the

484

specific concentrations of 1 mM and 10 mM. Red food dye (six drops per 500 ml
food) was added to the supplemented food to insure homogeneity. We did not
observe any significant differences in the weekly measurements of body weight
and length in flies fed cAMP analogs compared with control flies, confirming
that the cAMP-fed flies did not live longer simply because of drug-induced
dietary restriction.
cAMP concentration measurement. cAMP concentrations were determined
using a competitive immunoassay (Assay Designs’ Correlate-EIA cAMP kit).
Mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondria were isolated by gently crushing 40
to 80 flies in a 10-ml Kontes homogenizer with seven strokes of the pestle in
3 ml homogenization buffer consisting of 225 mM mannitol, 75 mM sucrose,
10 mM MOPS, 1 mM EGTA and 0.5% BSA (pH 7.2) at 4 1C (ref. 38). The
extracts were filtered through eight layers of cheesecloth and then centrifuged at
300g for 3 min in a Beckman Avanti J25. The supernatant was centrifuged at
6,000g for 10 min to obtain a mitochondrial pellet. Mitochondrial protein was
determined by the Bradford method using Bio-Rad reagents and correcting for
the BSA content in the homogenization buffer. Respiration rates were determined by oxygen consumption using a Clark-type electrode and metabolic
chamber containing 650 ml of reaction buffer consisting of 225 mM mannitol,
75 mM sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl and 5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.2) at
25 1C. Mitochondrial ATP production rates were calculated from ADP
consumption rates during state III respiration. Experiments used 5-d-old flies
except unless otherwise indicated in the text.
Complex I activity. The specific activity of complex I (NADH-ubiquinone
oxidoreductase) was determined as the rotenone (4 mM)-sensitive NADH
oxidation at 340 nm, using the coenzyme Q analog 2, 3-dimethyl-5-methyl
6-n-decyl-1,4-benzomethyluinone (DB) as an electron acceptor41.
Citrate synthase. Citrate synthase was analyzed by the reduction of 5,5¢dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid at 412 nm in the presence of acetyl-CoA
and oxaloacetate41.
ROS production. H2O2 leakage from intact mitochondria respiring on pyruvate and malate was quantified by the horseradish peroxidase–dependent
oxidation of p-hydroxyphenol acetic acid. We monitored 320 nm excitation and
400 nm emission via a Perkin Elmer L20B luminescence spectrometer. Hydrogen peroxide levels were interpolated from standard curves. The rate of
superoxide anion production was assayed in isolated mitochondria using
MitoSOX (Invitrogen) fluorescence at 510 nm excitation/580 nm emission.
Aconitase activity and reactivation. Mitochondrial aconitase activity was
measured on mitochondria sonicated four times for 15 s in a Branson 450
sonicator in 50 mM Tris, 30 mM sodium citrate, 0.5 mM MnCl2 and 0.2 mM
NADP (pH 7.3). The conversion of citrate into a-ketoglutarate was monitored
at 340 nm at 25 1C using the coupled reduction of NADP to NADPH by
2 units/ml of isocitrate dehydrogenase in 50 mM Tris, 1 mM cysteine, 1 mM
sodium citrate and 0.5 mM MnCl2 (pH 7.4). Aconitase was reactivated by
incubation with 2 mM dithiothreitol and 0.2 mM ferrous ammonium sulfate
for 5 min before repeating the enzymatic activity assay42.
Superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Superoxide dismutase activity
was measured spectrophotometrically at 560 nm by recording the reduction of
nitro blue tetrazolium. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount
that inhibited nitro blue tetrazolium reduction half-maximally in a 1 ml
reaction volume. MnSOD activity was measured by recording the cyanideinhabitable reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium43. Catalase activity was measured by spectrophotometrically monitoring the change in ultraviolet absorbance at 240 nm after adding whole cell extract or mitochondria alone44.
Antioxidant feeding. MnTBAP (Oxis) and MnTDEIP (Aeolus Pharmaceuticals) were dissolved in PBS (Mediatech) before further dilution with cornmeal
food to make desired concentration. Red food dye (six drops per 500 ml
food) was added to the food to ensure homogeneity. Based on the body
weight and length of the antioxidant-fed versus control flies monitored weekly,
we did not see any evidence that suggested differential food intake by the
experimental flies.

Neurofibromin detection and quantification. Neurobromin levels were determined by protein blot analysis. Ten flies (five males and five females) of each
category were homogenized in fly homogenization buffer containing 60 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 3% SDS, 2-mercaptoethanol, protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. We separated 40 mg protein
per lane by 10% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and then transferred it overnight
(15 h) at 200 mA to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nitrocellulose membranes
were incubated overnight at 4 1C with antisera to neurofibromin (Bethyl,
1:1,000 dilution). Blots were washed four times with washing buffer (10 min
each) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase–labeled goat antibody
against rabbit IgG (Amersham) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Blots were
washed four times with washing buffer (5 min each wash), incubated using the
ECL protein blotting analysis system (Amersham) for 1 min and exposed to
X-ray film for 2 min.
FOXO expression. The level of unphosphorylated (and thus active) FOXO
transcription factor was evaluated by reacting the above protein blots with a
FOXO1 antibody specific for the unphosphorylated form purchased from Cell
Signaling. The antibody was diluted 1:1,000.
