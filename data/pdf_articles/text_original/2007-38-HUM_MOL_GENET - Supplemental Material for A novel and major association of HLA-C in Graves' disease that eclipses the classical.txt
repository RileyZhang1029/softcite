Supplementary information
Geography
At each locus we examined the geographical variation in allele frequency by
multinomial logistic regression, to check if we were justified in pooling all three case
groups. We detected a significant variation in allele frequency between the case
cohorts at HLA-C, P = 0.0008, supplementary Tables 1 and 2. We also tested whether
the Midlands were different to the pooled South and Southwest case groups, again
HLA-C was different, P = 0.002, Supplementary Table 1. The difference in allele
frequency in our collection is attributable to HLA-C*03, which is less frequent in the
southern regions than in the Midlands.

five MHC loci typed.

Consequently, we analysed HLA-C in the Midlands as we did not have geographically
matched controls from the South and South Western regions. For the other loci there
was no evidence to suggest that allele frequency varied between centres of collection
therefore we report here the results in the full dataset of 1,571 individuals.
