The structure of the membrane-containing bacteriophage PRD1 has been determined by X-ray crystallography at about 4 A˚ resolution.
Here we describe the structure and location of proteins P3, P16, P30 and P31.
Different structural proteins seem to have specialist roles in controlling virus assembly.
The linearly extended P30 appears to nucleate the formation of the icosahedral facets (composed of trimers of the major capsid protein, P3) and acts as a molecular tape-measure, defining the size of the virus and cementing the facets together.
Pentamers of P31 form the vertex base, interlocking with subunits of P3 and interacting with the membrane protein P16.
The architectural similarities with adenovirus and one of the largest known virus particles PBCV-1 support the notion that the mechanism of assembly of PRD1 is scaleable and applies across the major viral lineage formed by these viruses.
PRD1 is a double-stranded DNA bacteriophage and prototype member of the Tectiviridae.
It infects Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica.
The mature virion has a molecular mass of 66 MDa and comprises over 20 distinct protein species1.
Protein P3 (43 kDa) is the major component of the capsid, with 240 trimers arranged on an icosahedral lattice with pseudo-T ¼ 25 triangulation.
Pentamers of protein P31 (14 kDa) occupy the icosahedral vertices and associate with the trimeric P5 protein (34 kDa) and the receptor-binding protein P2 (64 kDa) to form flexible spikes2.
The minor capsid protein P30 (9 kDa) is required for virus assembly3.
The 15-kilobase linear viral genome is packaged into preformed procapsids4 through a unique vertex5,6, fuelled by the ATPase P9 (J.K.H.B., unpublished data).
PRD1 is very different from the traditional DNA bacteriophages: instead of a tail it uses its internal membrane, acquired from the host during virus assembly4,7, as an ejection device8,9.
In addition, there is no critical capsid expansion after DNA packaging10.
However, PRD1 is remarkably similar to adenovirus, and several lines of evidence, including the structural homology between the major structural proteins, support the hypothesis that the two viruses have a common ancestor11–13.
Recently, the same structural characteristics have been found in the giant PBCV-1 (Phycodnaviridae family) and CIV viruses (Iridoviridae family)13–15, indicating that PRD1 belongs to an extensive lineage, whose origin might predate the division of the bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic domains of life13.
Previous cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) analysis of the PRD1 virion and X-ray analysis of isolated P3 illuminated aspects of PRD1 architecture10,11,16,17 but the analysis presented here, using crystals of the PRD1 Sus539 mutant1,18, reveals in atomic detail the key structural proteins, lays bare the organization of the capsid shell and reveals the membrane.
The structure of the membrane is described in the accompanying paper19.
Here we focus on the architecture of the PRD1 capsid, which suggests a scaleable assembly pathway that might apply to some of the largest known viruses and reveals receptor-binding vertex connections to the viral membrane.
Overall architecture of the virus and structural proteins The structure determination at about 4 A˚ resolution for the PRD1 68  Sus539 mutant is described in Methods.
Phase information was obtained by combining an X-ray structure of the major capsid protein11,20 with a cryo-EM reconstruction of the virus10,16.
Neglecting magnification errors, the deviation between Ca atoms derived from EM/X-ray hybrid imaging and the final X-ray structure is less than 2 A˚ within an icosahedral asymmetric unit.
The resolution of the resultant electron density map is sufficient to resolve the b-strands in protein P3 (Fig.
1a).
In addition, data from crystals of selenomethionated (SeMet) virus provide a SeMet difference Fourier map.
Using these two electron density maps we have constructed atomic models for the minor capsid protein P30, the vertex protein P31, the membrane protein P16 and previously undescribed portions of the major capsid protein (see Methods).
The analysis is based on 60-fold averaged electron density in which proteins not obeying the icosahedral symmetry are smeared out and are essentially invisible.
PRD1 measures about 640 A˚ between opposite faces and 700 A˚ between opposite vertices.
The Sus539 mutant lacks P2, the receptor-binding protein, whereas the trimeric P5 is not seen in the averaged electron density.
The 240 trimers of protein P3 dominate the PRD1 capsid (Fig.
1b).
Each P3 subunit is composed of two ‘jellyroll’ domains11,20, giving the trimer a pseudo-hexagonal shape.
The icosahedral asymmetric unit of the virus is composed of four P3 trimers (Fig.
1b) arranged in a uniform orientation within the roughly planar facet (root-mean-square (r.m.s.)
deviation from planarity 6.9 A˚), to give the pseudo-T ¼ 25 lattice characteristic of PRD1 and adenovirus.
The cores of the 12 independent copies of P3 are essentially identical to each other and to the single crystal structures of isolated P3 (ref.
11) (r.m.s.
deviation in Ca atoms, after superposition, is about 1 A˚).
There are, however, different conformations for the short amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal extensions, depending on the location of the subunit in the surface lattice of the virus, leading to small differences in the conformation of some loops (Fig.
1c).
We find that the capsid contains 60 copies of the small protein P30 (83 residues).
This protein is essential for the assembly of complete particles3.
P30 is remarkably extended, with essentially no secondary structure and dimensions of about 150 £ 60 £ 10 A˚3  ©2004 Nature Publishing Group  NATURE | VOL 432 | 4 NOVEMBER 2004 | www.nature.com/nature  articles (Fig.
1d).
The electron density of P30 is continuous, and detailed structural interpretation was assisted by the SeMet difference Fourier map, which pinpointed the methionine residues at positions 24, 45 and 69 (see Fig.
1d).
The molecule is rich in proline residues (13%) and analysis of its amino acid sequence with PONDR21 indicates that in the absence of other viral components at least the N-terminal half of the subunit would be disordered.
The 60 copies of P30 completely festoon the virus, being suspended about 12 A˚ above the viral membrane by numerous interactions with P3 (Fig.
1d).
N-terminal hooks (the only deviation from a fully extended conformation) lock two P30 subunits into the dimeric building block of the network (dimer interactions are restricted to  about the first 30 residues of the subunit).
Dimer axes coincide with icosahedral two-fold axes and the protein follows closely the outline of the P3 facet (P30/P3 interactions are described below).
Pentamers of protein P31 plug the 60-A˚ diameter holes in the P3/P30 shell at the five-fold vertices.
P31 forms a compact eightstranded b-barrel with jellyroll topology (Fig.
1e), elaborated only by 13-residue and 8-residue extensions at the N and C termini respectively.
Residues 5–118 of the 126-amino-acid subunit have been modelled with the aid of the SeMet difference Fourier map.
P31 resembles half of a P3 subunit and can be superposed almost equally well on either of the P3 jellyrolls (82 and 83 Ca atoms superposed for domains 1 and 2, respectively, in each case with an  Figure 1 Architecture and structural components of bacteriophage PRD1.

Finally, beneath each P31 pentamer lie five copies of protein P16.
Residues 7–56 and 94–116 are visible in the electron density, with residues 7–28 forming a transmembrane helix.
The assignment of P16 is described in Methods.
In closed assemblies, geometric constraints prevent an exactly symmetric arrangement of more than 60 subunits.
The switching of subunit conformation during the assembly process provides a mechanism for building more complex systems (see, for example, refs 23 and 24), and this was suggested for PRD1 (ref.
17).
The 720 subunits of P3 present in each PRD1 particle occupy 12 distinct  local environments within each facet (Fig.
2), which define the conformations of the N-terminal and C-terminal extensions.
Whereas in the intact virus these extensions are generally well ordered, in the crystal structure of isolated P3 both termini were disordered (about 13 and 11 residues respectively)11,20 implying that there is little energetic penalty in switching between conformers.
The N termini of P3 fall into two distinct conformations (denoted NI and NII) that converge at residue 18 (between 9 and 12 A˚ above the outer leaflet of the membrane).
Residues 18–34 form an a-helix that runs away from the membrane.
In one set of conformations (NII, shown in dark blue in Figs 1c and 2) this helix is longer, beginning at residue 8, and is preceded by a short extended section of chain that contacts the membrane (Fig.
2).
Three of the first six amino acids are glutamine residues, which probably attach to the  Figure 2 Switching of the P3 termini.

The first six residues of P16 beneath the membrane are disordered but are shown for completeness.

These membraneanchoring P3 subunits are found along the edge of the icosahedral facets and might help to stabilize the fold in the membrane that occurs at this intersection19.
In the other N-terminal conformation (NI, shown in cyan in Figs 1c and 2), the residues preceding 18 form a short a-helix twisted away from the membrane (Fig.
2) to interact with another subunit of the P3 trimer and, for subunits within the body of the facet, with the C termini (residues 385–390) of P3 subunits from neighbouring trimers.
This conformational switching allows the P3 N termini to stabilize either the viral membrane or interactions with neighbouring P3 molecules.
The switching of the P3 C termini is central to the assembly process, because these structures mediate P3 trimer–trimer interactions.
As with the N-terminal switching, the four subunits within the body of the icosahedral face have essentially the same structure (denoted CI in Figs 1c and 2).
In this conformation, after a short helix (residues 383–389) the final six residues extend to form a trimeric interaction with termini from neighbouring trimers, locking a set of three trimers together (Fig.
2).
The electron density and the presence of acidic residues suggest that this structure might be further stabilized by a divalent cation lying on the local inter-trimer three-fold axis.
In conformation CII (brick red on Figs 1c and 2), adopted by six subunits, the helix is replaced by an extended chain.
These extensions (which constitute three subsets, CIIa–c; see Fig.
2) form b-structures with P30, which threads between the P3 trimers of neighbouring facets.
P30 is clamped by P3 in four b-sheets along the edge of the facet (Fig.
2), stabilizing the facet interface.
The final two P3 C-terminal structures (short red arrows in Fig.
2, found in the peripentonal P3 trimers and subunits abutting them) are disordered, eliminating C-terminal interactions between the peripentonal trimers and the rest of the structure.
Interactions at the vertex Five subunits of P31 pack with their jellyrolls vertical to form the pentameric base of the vertex spike (Fig.
3a).
The pentamer is stabilized by residues 9–14 (strand A in Fig.

neighbour.
A series of interactions engage the P31 pentamer with the P3 subunits that surround it.
The nine N-terminal residues of P31 interdigitate between the B1–C1 and B2–C2 b-strands of fivefold related P3 subunits, and the ACHEF face of P31 nestles between the two jellyrolls of a peripentonal P3 subunit (Fig.
3a).
There is a symmetry mismatch between the pentameric P31 and the trimeric spike protein P5 (a similar symmetry mismatch is found in adenovirus25).
P31 and the N-terminal domain of P5 share 38% sequence identity26,27, which might allow a mixed pentameric association of P31 with the N-terminal domains of P5 (ref.
28).
However, there is little evidence for this in the electron density maps: P31 is generally well defined, although the attenuation of the SeMet difference Fourier peak for residue Met9 would be consistent with up to two of the five subunits being P5.
The C termini of P31 lie close to the five-fold axes, in line with direct P5–P31 interactions at these axes17,27.
Below P31, in a position where unidentified density was seen in cryo-EM analysis17, lies the 117-residue integral membrane protein P16 (ref.
29) (Fig.
3b, c), anchored into the membrane through a single transmembrane helix (residues 7–28).
Residues 1–6 are disordered beneath the membrane, with the triple lysine sequence 3–5 presumably stabilizing the negative charge of the viral DNA.
There is no electron density for residues 57–93, indicating that this portion (denoted loop57–93) does not obey icosahedral symmetry.
The trajectory of the polypeptide chain entering and leaving loop57–93 indicates that it resides in a cylindrical cavity under the vertex (Fig.
3b), which it largely fills (see Supplementary Methods).
P16 engages in extensive interactions with the P3 trimers adjacent to the vertex and the C-terminal region of the cementing protein P30 (Fig.
3b).
The vertex complexes and peripentonal P3 trimers are labile in PRD1 virions lacking P16 (ref.
29), whereas removal of the phage membrane from PRD1 particles lacking DNA, by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulphate, removes the vertex complex and peripentonal P3 trimers30.
Thus P16 acts as a second cementing protein stabilizing the vertices, a function analogous to that of adenovirus polypeptide VI (ref.
31).
The observed lability of the vertex might facilitate the formation of a pore in the capsid for egress of the PRD1 DNA injection tube32.
The disordered loop57–93 probably forms non-icosahedrally symmetric interactions with the vertex base, presumably explaining arms of electron density seen connecting the P16 region and capsid vertex in the cryo-EM analysis17.
The breakdown in icosahedral symmetry might reflect the symmetry mismatch between the pentameric vertex base and the trimeric spike shaft.
Perhaps P16 acts as the component that transmits the receptor-binding signal to the membrane, priming the metastable system for DNA ejection2.
In addition to P16, 11 further protein species have been reported to be associated with the viral membrane1,4,32–35; in particular, two integral membrane proteins and two capsid-associated proteins are located at a unique vertex responsible for DNA packaging5,6.
We see no evidence of these proteins in the averaged electron density maps and unaveraged electron density maps show no features to suggest a preferred orientation of the special vertices within the crystal lattice.
Visualization of the remaining membrane proteins is therefore probably beyond the reach of the current data.

2), with the C-terminal tail of P30 reaching the penton where it also interlocks with protein P16 (at residues 70–79 of P30).
Large viruses frequently use a scaffolding protein to drive assembly and control the capsid size36, for example gp8 of bacteriophage P22 and gp7 of bacteriophage f29, both of which are elongated proteins with a substantial a-helical content36,37.
P30 of PRD1 is even more elongated, being almost completely extended, allowing the dimer to span the entire edge of an icosahedral facet (about 300 A˚).
In effect P30 acts as a molecular tape-measure, a function attributed to protein YscP in the assembly of the bacterial injectisome, and also responsible for the determination of phage tail length (ref.
38 and references therein).
The linear nature of the 83-residue P30 would allow a virus of eightfold the mass of PRD1 to be assembled with a minimal ‘P30’ of less than 200 residues, and very large viruses (ref.
14, and S. D. Benson, J. K. H. Bamford, D. H. Bamford and R. M. Burnett, unpublished data) could be assembled with a tape-measure protein of only 300 amino acids.
The efficient and accurate assembly of such complex structures with many thousands of subunits presents numerous challenges, but the limited conformational switching seen in PRD1 P3 suggests a plausible pathway in which assembly is governed by extensive b-sheet interactions between P3 and P30.
The use of preformed P3 trimers and P30 dimers probably provides early quality-control steps in the assembly pathway.
A plausible assembly model could involve the initial attachment of two copies of P3 trimer 2 (defined in Fig.
2) around the P30 dimer axis, followed by the attachment of trimers 3 and 1 (probably with fairly independent kinetics) to form the binding face to which trimer 4 then binds.
Such an assembly of eight trimers of P3 and a dimer of P30 would represent 1/30 of the virus, and these preformed units might then clip together to form the complete virus shell.
P31, P16 and perhaps other proteins are likely to be involved in the final stages of the assembly process.
Particle formation is also aided by two nonstructural assembly factors, P10 and P17 (ref.
32), with a large amount of P10 being associated with the viral membrane during capsid assembly3.
We suggest that P10 is involved in the formation of correctly sized membrane vesicles, which the assembling procapsid selects through a size-exclusion mechanism to form an empty virion into which the genome is packaged through a single special vertex6,32.
Generic features of assembly of a major virus lineage The structure of the major capsid protein of the massive PBCV-1 (ref.
15) validated the proposal13 that the Phycodnaviridae and Iridoviridae belong to the PRD1/adenovirus structure-based lineage, and analysis (S. D. Benson, J. K. H. Bamford, D. H. Bamford and R. M. Burnett, unpublished data) suggests that the ‘doublebarrelled’ major capsid protein is present in other virus families including the Asfarviridae, the Ascoviridae and the very large Mimivirus.
However, the set of core properties that defines the PRD1/adenovirus lineage might extend beyond the architecture of the major structural protein.
The PRD1 vertex protein, P31, resembles a single jellyroll domain of P3, and presumably these proteins originated from a common ancestor constructed from a single jellyroll.
The divergence of P3 and P31 probably occurred before the separation of adenovirus from PRD1, so the adenovirus penton base might possess a much elaborated jellyroll (molecular mass 63 kDa, in comparison with 13 kDa for P31), echoing the relationship between P3 of PRD1 and the adenovirus hexon11.
The pseudo-hexagonal arrangement of structurally homologous trimeric molecules into triangular facets is another core property of the PRD1/adenovirus lineage, which probably reflects underlying similarities in the assembly mechanism13–15.
Thus, adenovirus might possess a homologue of P30.
Although postulated to have an analogous function31, polypeptide IIIa is larger than expected for NATURE | VOL 432 | 4 NOVEMBER 2004 | www.nature.com/nature  a P30 homologue and is a less attractive candidate than polypeptide VIII, which is proline-rich, is almost exactly the expected length (110 residues) and possesses an N-terminal sequence that PONDR21 predicts to be disordered.
The larger capsids such as PBCV-1 are, like PRD1 and adenovirus, assembled principally out of triangular plates composed of trimers of a single protein arranged with p3 symmetry39, with neighbouring plates related by icosahedral twofold axes, suggesting that all these viruses might use a tape-measure mechanism to control assembly.
Further structural analyses are required to test this hypothesis.
Discussion Bacteriophage PRD1 adopts a simple and effective strategy for protein shell assembly.
The bulk of the capsid is cemented together by protein P30, and the vertex is stabilized by the integral membrane protein P16.
The latter seems to act as a metastable sensor, linking the symmetry-mismatched vertex base and receptor-binding spike shaft with the membrane and providing a mechanism for the controlled extrusion of a membrane–protein–DNA tube to initiate host entry.
Particle assembly seems to be regulated by P30, which acts as a molecular tape-measure, modulating a two-state conformational switch in the major capsid protein (P3) to control both the assembly of an initial P30–P3 core structure and the proliferation of P3–P3 contacts.
This allows 60 subunits of the small, essentially linear, P30 protein to control the assembly of 720 P3 subunits.
This model can be easily scaled to very large systems, and circumstantial evidence indicates that it might underpin some of the most complex self-assembling systems found in biology.

The data from native crystals fall into two sets with the same spacegroup P212121 but different unit cell dimensions18.
The SeMet-substituted crystals were isomorphous with native cell 1.
The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains an entire virus particle.
Data statistics are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure.
Intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes with TRUNCATE42.
Phasing and phase refinement Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with the use of a quasi-atomic model of the viral capsid (PDB entry 1HB7) derived from fitting a 14 A˚ cryo-EM reconstruction16.
The position and orientation of this model were refined against the experimental data using X-PLOR 3.1 (ref.
43).
This was performed separately for data from the cell 1 and cell 2 crystal forms.
An initial estimate of the particle orientation was obtained from the self-rotation function calculated from the cell 1 data set.
Patterson correlation refinement44 was performed against 60–15-A˚ resolution data to optimize the orientation (final correlation coefficient (cc) of 0.021 for cell 1 and 0.027 for cell 2).
The position and orientation of the particle were then refined at 30 A˚ with the E1E1 target function43 (cc ¼ 0.196 for cell 1, 0.195 for cell 2), giving an initial set of noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators for the two cell types.
P3 trimers inside the icosahedral asymmetric unit were refined at 6 A˚ resolution and NCS operators were rerefined at 8 A˚ resolution43 (cc ¼ 0.375 for cell 1, 0.546 for cell 2).
Further refinement of the trimer positions and the NCS operators with data to 5 A˚ gave final correlation coefficients of 0.230 and 0.423 for cell 1 and cell 2, respectively.
A 2F o 2 F c map was calculated for each cell type (to 4.2 A˚ resolution) with the corresponding model phases, which were then refined by iterative solvent flattening and 60-fold averaging; F c was calculated from the starting model or from Fourier transformation of the modified map (see Table 2) (program GAP; D.I.S.
and J.M.G., unpublished program, and CCP4 programs42).
For missing reflections, including those at low resolution, appropriately weighted F c values were used.
Calculation of the SeMet difference map The SeMet and native cell 1 data were scaled in resolution shells with the use of SHELLSCALE (D.I.S., unpublished program).
Difference Fourier maps were calculated using cell 1 phases and difference attenuation weighting to down-weight terms with large experimental errors45.
The maps were 60-fold averaged.
The mean (m) and standard  ©2004 Nature Publishing Group  73  articles deviation (j) of the electron density was evaluated in hollow shells (outer and inner radii 30 and 15 A˚, respectively) around each methionine residue in the P3, P30, P31 and P16 models, as well as the height of the difference peak (r max) and the signal-to-noise ratio (r max 2 m)/j.
Varying the partiality threshold and resolution showed that the difference map calculated to 4.2 A˚ with partiality threshold 0.5 gave the highest mean signal-to-noise ratio (9.4).
Model building The P3 N- and C-terminal regions were built into the averaged map of cell 2 by using O46.
Major movements of the loop regions of the different P3 subunits were fitted manually to the electron density.
The SeMet difference Fourier showed five other strong peaks in the icosahedral asymmetric unit in addition to those attributable to P3.
The location of three of these and the quality of the native map led to the unequivocal identification and tracing of the minor capsid protein P30 (residues 1–83).
The electron density close to the five-fold axes was also interpreted.
A jellyroll fold was apparent and a preliminary model was manually fitted as a rigid body, followed by retracing to match the observed map.
The unique SeMet peak at position 9 identified this protein as the pentameric vertex protein P31 (residues 5–118).
The electron density maps revealed two apparently disconnected polypeptide fragments located between the peri-pentonal P3 trimers (Fig.
3b).
Fragment I is a roughly 50-residue peptide containing a transmembrane helix about 20 residues long and a methionine residue (identified in the SeMet difference Fourier) about 11 residues from the point of contact with the membrane.
Fragment II consists of about 23 amino acids, terminating in a roughly 17-residue a-helix.
Analysing the relative positions of methionine residues and predicted transmembrane helices (program TMHMM47) in all the candidate sequences from the virus showed that fragment I belonged to the N-terminal region of the 117-residue integral membrane protein P16, predicted to possess an 18-residue transmembrane helix between residues 7 and 24.
Placing an a-helix into the transmembrane electron density (Fig.
3b, right) and positioning the P16 residue Met 41 in the vicinity of the SeMet peak enabled the construction of a Ca trace for P16 residues 7–56.
To give the best fit to the electron density, the transmembrane helix was extended from residue 24 to residue 28.
Fragment II was assigned as the P16 C terminus on the basis of protein packing density considerations in the cavity under the vertex (see Supplementary Methods) and the alignment of tyrosines at positions 103 and 110 (the largest amino acids in the C-terminal sequence) to two particularly pronounced bumps seven residues apart (Fig.
3c).
All structures were brought into conformity with expected backbone conformations and side chains were built with program CALPHA48.

1  Supplementary Methods The cavity under the vertex is roughly cylindrical, having a radius of ~25Å and depth ~30Å (Fig.
3b).
The P16 polypeptide chain becomes disordered after residue 56, and if this cavity had to accommodate the remaining 300 P16 residues (5 copies of 60 residues from the symmetry related P16 molecules around the vertex), the Matthews Coefficient Vm for the cavity would be 1.8Å3/Da.
Furthermore, since Fragment II is too small to be an entire protein, the cavity would also have to accommodate the disordered amino acids from the protein of which fragment II forms a part.
This would give Vm < 1.8 Å3/Da, corresponding to the maximum possible packing density for proteins.
This scenario seems unlikely given that the cavity appears quite empty in the electron density maps.
We believe that fragment II is the P16 C-terminus, since then the cavity would only accommodate 5 loops of ~37 residues, giving Vm ~ 2.9Å3/Da, with no additional protein in the cavity being necessary to account for the observed electron density.
