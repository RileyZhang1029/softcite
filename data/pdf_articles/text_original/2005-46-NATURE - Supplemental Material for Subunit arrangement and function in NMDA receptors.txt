Protein purification and crystallization
The rat NR2A S1S2 ligand-binding core contains residues P401-R539 (S1) and Q661N802 (S2) connected by a Gly-Thr linker. NR2A S1S2 was expressed and purified as
for rat NR1 S1S21 except that 0.5% CHAPS and 250 mM NaCl were included in the NiNTA purification step and trypsin was used to cleave the polyhistidine tag. NR2A S1S2
and NR1/NR2A S1S2 crystals were grown by vapour diffusion at 4oC. The NR2A S1S2
crystals were grown by mixing equal volumes of protein (5 mg ml-1) prepared in a
buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM sodium glutamate,
and reservoir solution containing 8-17% PEG8000, 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), and 200
mM calcium acetate. The NR1/NR2A S1S2 crystals were made by mixing individually
purified NR1 S1S2 and NR2A S1S2 in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio (6 mg ml-1 total) and
by combining the protein mix with reservoir solution containing 10-16% PEG8000, 100
mM HEPES (pH 7.0), and 100 mM calcium acetate in a 2:1 ratio. The crystals were
cryoprotected by soaking in the reservoir solution supplemented with 18% glycerol.
The bromide derivative was prepared by soaking the crystal in the cryobuffer with NaBr
added to a final concentration of 0.5 M.

Crosslinking
The mutants, NR1 N521C L777C and NR2A E516C L780C, were expressed in
Xenopus oocytes using the same methods that were employed in the two-electrode
voltage clamp experiments except that 5 ng of RNA was injected per oocyte. After two
days, the membrane fraction from ten oocytes was solubilized in a buffer containing 20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1% β-dodecyl maltoside, 1/1,000 volume of
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide in a 100 µl volume. A

2

sample amount equivalent to one oocyte was loaded per lane in SDS-PAGE and
subjected to the Western blot analysis using anti-NR1 (amino acids: 660-811) and antiNR2A (amino acids: 1253-1391, Chemicon) antibodies under reducing (100 mM DTT)
and non-reducing conditions.

Light scattering analysis
A Superdex 200 HR (10/30) column was coupled to the light scattering system,
refractive index (Wyatt Technology), and UV (Shimadzu) detectors. Light scattering
was measured using a linearly polarized GaAs laser at λ = 690 nm. The system was
equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM glycine, and 1 mM L-glutamate. All of the samples were
concentrated to 0.8 mg ml-1 and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer as above.
Light scattering data, collected from 57o to 126o by 9 detectors, were analyzed using the
Debye equation with an assumption that a value of dn/dc (increment of refractive
index/increment of protein concentration) is 0.187 ml g-1.

Sedimentation velocity experiments
Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Coulter Optima XLI analytical ultracentrifuge with interference optics and sapphire windows. Prior to these
runs, the wild-type proteins were prepared as described for the mutant proteins in the
sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Samples were loaded into two-sector, 12-mm
charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces at 3 mg ml-1 and run at 42,000 rpm in an An50Ti rotor
at 4ºC until all of the material had completely pelleted.

Interference scans were

acquired at 4-min intervals with a 0.003-cm spacing and one replicate per point. Data

3

were analyzed with the continuous distribution c(S) Lamm equation implemented in
Sedfit2 using every other scan.

Figure S1 Mechanism of glutamate binding in NR2A. a, Fo-Fc ‘omit’ electron
density map using data to 1.7 Å where coordinates for W1, W2, glutamate, and
selected residues are omitted. The contour level is at 3.0 σ. b, Interaction of
glutamate with the NR2A residues and the two water molecules. Dashed lines
represent hydrogen bonds or salt bridges. c, Superposition of NR2A (slate) and
GluR2 (pink) bound to the respective glutamate molecules. The water and the

respectively. d, Possible mechanism for NMDA specificity in NMDA receptors.
An NMDA molecule is modelled into the binding site using the bound glutamate
structure as a guide. The arrow indicates how the GluR2 E705 side chain would
collide with the N-methyl group (sphere) of NMDA, precluding the binding of
NMDA to the GluR2 binding pocket.

Figure S2 Sedimentation velocity analysis of the wild-type S1S2 proteins. a-c,
NR1 S1S2 (a), NR2A S1S2 (b), and an equimolar mixture of the NR1/NR2A
species (c), all at 3 mg ml-1, were centrifuged at 42,000 rpm and at 4ºC. For
each sample, the four panels represent, from the top, experimental fringe units,
residuals (in fringe units) from the continuous distribution c(S) Lamm equation
model, continuous distribution [c(M)] of the sedimentation coefficient, and
continuous distribution of the molecular weight. Scans were recorded at 4-min
intervals, but in the uppermost panels, only every fourth scan is shown for
clarity. Note the single major peaks at 1.82 S, 1.67 S, and 1.81 S in the
sedimentation coefficient distribution for NR1, NR2A, and the NR1/NR2A
equimolar mixture, respectively. These values correspond to molecular weights

2

of 35.9, 34.4, and 34.6 kDa, all of which are within 7-8% of the respective
monomer sequence molecular weights.

Figure S3 Effect of mutations at the NR1/NR2A interface on the glycine and
glutamate EC50. a-b, Glutamate (a) and glycine (b) dose responses for the
tyrosine mutants (NR1 N521Y/NR2A E516Y). c-d, Glutamate (c) and glycine (d)
dose responses for the double cysteine mutants (NR1 N521C L777C/NR2A
E516C L780C). The wild-type (WT) and mutant (M) NR1 and NR2A receptors,
coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, were assessed by two-electrode voltage
clamp at -60 mV. In both the tyrosine and the cysteine mutants, significant
increases in the glycine and glutamate EC50 values were only observed with the
M/M combination (filled square), whereas significantly less or no effect was
observed with WT/WT (circle), WT/M (triangle), or M/WT (filled diamond).
Although speculative, we suggest that this increase in EC50 in M/M may
represent an enhancement of negative cooperativity between the NR1 and
NR2A subunits caused by a stabilization of the subunit interface. Error bars
represent ± s.d. for normalized data points from the indicated number of
experiments in Table S3.

Figure S4 Effect of the NR1 Y535S mutation on the affinity of purified NR1
S1S2 for glycine. a, A representative plot for saturation binding of
[3H]MDL105,519. The calculated Kd values are 17.7 ± 3.6 and 21.6 ± 2.5 nM for
wild-type and NR1 Y535S, respectively. Error bars represent ± s.e.m. from a
triplicate experiment. Two such experiments were carried out to determine the
Kd values. b, Binding of [3H]MDL105,519 (30 nM) was displaced by various

3

concentrations of glycine. The calculated Ki values for glycine are 63.0 ± 24.4
and 157.2 ± 26.5 µM for wild-type and NR1 Y535S, respectively. Error bars
represent ± s.e.m. for normalized data points from two triplicate experiments.

All data were collected with the absorbance optical system at 280 nm. The global fit in WinNONLIN included three rotor speeds
(13,000, 18,000, and 25,000 rpm) and three loading concentrations (0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mg/ml).
b
Data were fit to one of three possible models: single species monomer, monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium with the monomer
molecular mass fixed to the correct sequence mass, or a monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium with the monomer mass allowed to float as
a separate variable. Alternative models, such as single species dimer, monomer ↔ dimer ↔ tetramer, and monomer ↔ tetramer
were also explored, but none of these possibilities fit the sedimentation data well.

Three different combinations of wild-type (WT) and mutant (M) (NR1/2A = M/M, WT/M, and M/WT)
are expressed for the tyrosine mutants (Tyr) and the cysteine mutants (Cys) in Xenopus oocytes and
assayed for glutamate or glycine dose-responses in the presence of 300 µM glycine or glutamate,
respectively. The data points are fitted to the equation response = Emax(1+(EC50/[ligand])nH)-1 where
Emax is the maximum response, EC50 is the half maximal response, [ligand] is the ligand concentrations,
and nH is the Hill coefficient. Values are means ± s.d. from the indicated number of oocytes.

The NR1 Y535 mutants or wild-type expressed with wild-type NR2A in HEK293 cells
are assessed with outside-out patch clamp at -70 mV holding potential. The outside-out
patch is exposed to 1 mM glutamate in the presence of 0.1 mM glycine for 3 ms and
washed out with a buffer containing 0.1 mM glycine (Glutamate) or to 1 mM glycine in
the presence of 0.1 mM glutamate for 3 ms and washed out with a buffer containing 0.1
mM glutamate (Glycine). Twenty to thirty traces are averaged per experiment and the
current decays are fitted to the double exponential equation described in “Methods.”
Values are means ± s.d. from ten different patches. As previously noted, we too observed
variation in deactivation kinetics, perhaps due to variable degrees of receptor
phosphorylation1. Labeled by asterisks are the mean values that are significantly different
from the wild-type response (p < 0.05).
