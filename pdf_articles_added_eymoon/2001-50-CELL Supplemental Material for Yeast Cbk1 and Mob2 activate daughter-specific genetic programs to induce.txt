Genetic and Molecular Biological Methods

Nucleic acid and yeast manipulations were performed as described ( [Ausubel et al. 1988] and [Dohrmann et al. 1996]).
Yeast Strains

Strains are detailed in Table 3. YAS245-5C (can1::HO-CAN1 ho::HO-ADE2 ura3 ade2 leu2 trp1 his3) is a W303a derivative (Anita Sil, personal communication). Other strains in Table 1a derive from YAS245-5C. We constructed ACLY245, ACLY311, ACLY313, ACLY363, ACLY368 and ACLY369 by deleting the corresponding gene from YAS245-5C (245, 311, 313 and 363) or ACLY364 (368 and 369) by PCR mediated one-step deletion of using pFA6a-kanMX6, pFA6a-His3MX6 or pFA6a-TRP1 (Longtine et al., 1998). We constructed ACLY315 by inserting into YAS245-5C a PCR product containing GFP from plasmid pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-His3MX6 downstream of the CBK1 coding sequence. We constructed ACLY362 and ACLY364 by inserting a PCR product that contained the entire YFP coding sequence into YAS245-5C from plasmid pYFP-His3MX6 downstream of the CTS1 or MOB2 coding sequence. We checked all PCR-mediated integrations by using PCR to verify the structure of the expected junctions. We made ACLY330 by replacing the endogenous CBK1 gene with the mutant copy carried by pCBK1-M429A using the two step integration-excision gene replacement approach (Guthrie and Fink, 1991) and ACLY382 by integrating pACE2-G128E at the ace2 locus. To construct TCY1, we integrated sequentially, p404-GEV and p406-YFp into the trp1 and ura3 loci, respectively.
Plasmids

We constructed YFP reporter plasmids as follows. We isolated a KpnI-BamHI fragment containing PGAL1, the EcoRI and XhoI sites, and the ADH1 terminator from pJG4-4 (Geyer et al., 1999) and introduced it into pRS316 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989) to generate pACL7. We made YFP by PCR mediated site-directed mutagenesis of the GFP sequence from the wild type gene from A. victoria and introduced the gene into pACL7 cut with EcoRI and XhoI to make pACL7-YFP. We removed the PGAL1 fragment by digesting pACL7-YFP with Acc65I and EcoRI to make a plasmid backbone into which we introduced fragments containing other promoters. We made pACL12, pACL13 and pACL14 by inserting into this backbone PCR fragments from YAS245-5C genomic DNA that carried PCTS1, PSIC1 and PHO. Fragments spanned from -762 to -1, -1213 to -1, and -1807 to -1 (where -1 is the nucleotide upstream of the start codon of each gene). To introduce promoters for ASH1, PIR3, PCL2, PCL9, EGT2, PST1, SCW11, PRY3, RME1, CST13, YPL158C, YDL117W, YOR263C, DSE3 (YOR264W), YNL046W, YNL078W, DSE4 (YNR067C), DSE1 (YER124C), DSE2 (YHR143W), YGR149W, TEC1, CDC6, PCL2, FAA3, YGR086C, YMR316C-A genes into pACL7-YFP, we PCR-amplified from YAS245-5C DNA a fragment that spanned from -1200 to -1 upstream of each coding sequence. Primers contained at their 5¢ end 20 nucleotides identical to Acc65I- and EcoRI-cut pACL7 backbone (5' ctaaagggaacaaaagctgg 3' and 5' tttactcatggatccgaatt 3', respectively). We then performed a second PCR using 60mer primers identical to the backbone and that overlapped by 20bp the first primer set (5' gctatgaccatgattacgccaagcgcggaattaacccgcactaaagggaacaaaagctgg 3'and 5' caacaagaattgggacaactccagtgaaaagttcttctcctttactcatggatccgaatt 3'). We introduced this PCR product along with pACL7-YFP cut with Acc65I and EcoRI into YAS245-5C. We rescued recombinant plasmids into E.coli and confirmed their identity by DNA sequencing of the fragment and plasmid flanks.

We constructed pYFP-His3MX6 by cloning a YFP PCR product cut with BamHI and AscI into BamHI and AscI cut pFA6a-GFP(S65T)-His3MX6. To make pACE2-YFP-Ace2 we introduced a -1200 to -1 fragment from ACE2 into the Acc65I/ EcoRI pACL7-YFP backbone. We then introduced the ACE2 coding sequence into this plasmid downstream of YFP. We made pACE2-YFP-Ace2-G128E by PCR-mediated site directed mutagenesis of pACE2-YFP-Ace2 (codon 128 GGA into GAA). To construct pACE2-G128E we first made pACE2-G128E-CEN by removing the YFP coding sequence from pACE2-YFP-Ace2-G128E by in vivo recombination. To do this we transformed ACLY311 yeast (?ace2) with pACE2-YFP-Ace2-G128E cut with BsrGI (which cuts within the YFP coding sequence), along with a PCR product obtained using YAS245-5C genomic DNA spanning the region from -200 to +300 of ACE2. Homologous recombination of this PCR product with the BsrGI cut plasmid removes the YFP coding region and yields a plasmid with a copy of ace2-G128E, that should complement the ?ace2 genetic background. We therefore identified recombinant colonies (not fluorescent colonies in which the ?ace2 cell separation defect was complemented) by fluorescence microscopy. Then we subcloned a KpnI/NotI fragment containing ace2-G128E from pACE2-G128E-CEN into pRS406 to make pACE2-G128E. We constructed p406-CBK1 by introducing a PCR product that spanned from -491 upstream to +722 downstream of CBK1 into pRS406. We made pCBK1-M429A by PCR site directed mutagenesis of p406-CBK1 (codon 429 ATG into GCT).

We made p404-GEV by subcloning an EcoRI/NotI fragment from pGEV-HIS3 (Gao and Pinkham, 2000) containing the MRP7 promoter followed by the GEV chimera into pRS404. We made p406-YFP by introducing an Acc65I/NotI fragment from pACL7-YFP containing the GAL1 promoter followed by the YFP gene and the ADH1 terminator into Acc65I/NotI cut pRS406.
Growth Conditions and Cell Cycle Arrest

To test promoter expression patterns, we first grew colonies bearing the appropriate plasmids or integrated constructs overnight in BSM (QBiogene, Inc, Carlsbad, CA) 2% glucose. We then diluted these cultures to OD600 0.1 in BSM 2% raffinose and allowed them to grow to OD600 0.5 at 30°C, then prepared the cells for microscopy. The slow growth of cells on raffinose allows YFP synthesized during late M or early G1 to be degraded before the next round of cell division (in our hands, the half life of YFP is approximately 2h, see below). To determine the pattern of expression in saturated cultures, we diluted overnight cultures to OD600 0.1 in BSM 2% (w/v) glucose and allowed the cultures to grow to OD600 5 (~108 cells/ml) at 30°C before examination. Since YFP fluorescence is very low on standard (pH5.0) synthetic medium, to image secreted Cts1-YFP in ACLY362 cells, we shifted exponentially growing cells to synthetic medium equilibrated to pH 7.0 (with phosphate buffer) for 2 hours before observation.

To synchronize cells, we arrested them with a factor as described (Futcher, 1999). Briefly, we diluted overnight cultures to OD600 0.08 in BSM 2% glucose and grew them to OD600 0.3 at 30°C. At this point we added 3mM a factor. As judged by microscopic observation, cells were arrested and shmooing 90 minutes later. We removed a factor by filtration and rinsing, resuspended the cells in fresh BSM 2% glucose medium and took samples every 10 minutes.
Imaging

We fixed cells for fluorescent microscopy by adding paraformaldehyde (buffered to pH 7.2 with phosphate buffer) to 2% for 1 hour on ice. We washed the cells in PBS twice before examination. To image living cells, we directly mounted samples in growing medium. To stain DNA or chitin, we respectively added DAPI (100 ng/ml) or calcofluor (100 ng/ml) just before mounting.

We determined GFP and YFP fluorescence using the Piston GFP and the HQ YFP filter set (sets 41025 and 41028 from Chroma Technologies Corp, Brattleboro, Vermont), respectively. We imaged DAPI and calcofluor using the DAPI filter set (set 31000 from Chroma). We captured and analyzed images using a SPOT2e CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, Michigan) coupled to MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA).

For time-lapse photomicroscopy we mounted living cells on 2% agarose pads prepared in BSM with 2% glucose. To do this, we dropped 400 µl of melted medium on a 75X50 mm glass slide and immediately applied a 75×38 mm glass slide on top. After 2 min, we cleaned out excess solidified agarose from the sides and removed the top slide. We then applied to the resulting thin agarose layer a 3 µl drop containing briefly sonicated yeast and coved the drop with a 22×22 mm glass coverslip. We removed excess agarose with a razor blade and sealed the edges with melted wax. We then mounted the slide on the microscope and took two-second exposures at the indicated time intervals over a period of two hours.

We quantified the fluorescence from the resulting images and computed YFP-based fluorescence at each time as follows. First, we measured YFP photobleaching by imaging wt cells that contained YFP that had been synthesized under the control of the GAL1 promoter. These cells contained YFP but did not express new YFP for 2s out of every 4s, over a total of 240s. These cells contained YFP under the control of the GAL1 promoter. We regulated the starting YFP level by shifting exponentially growing cells from BSM 2% glucose to BSM 2% raffinose, 1% galactose for three hours, followed by a return to BSM 2% glucose for 30 minutes before imaging. We observed autofluorescence photobleaching by imaging cells lacking YFP for 2s, out of every 4s over 240s as above. We obtained the photobleaching function, ? = 0.071 + 0.977e-0.06t, where t is the single image exposure time in seconds, by fitting the net fluorescence data (YFP minus autofluorescence) from these experiments to an offset exponential function (R2 = 0.9978). We then quantified the amount of YFP in the nucleus of individual cells in a visual field using the formula

where YFPi and YFPi-1 are the computed YFP-based fluorescence at times i and i-1, respectively, Obsi and Obsi-1 are the total observed fluorescence at times i and i-1, respectively, Autoi and Autoi-1 are the observed autofluorescence (fluorescence from cells in the field that do not contain YFP) at times i and i-1, respectively, and ? is the fraction of YFP fluorescence remaining after photobleaching.

Determination of YFP half life

To determine the half life of YFP in yeast we used the following model for YFP concentration. At a given time t, the rate of change in the concentration of protein Y is determined by its rate of synthesis, ks, its rate of decay, kd and its dilution by cell growth, kg:

dY/dt = ks - kd [Y] - kg [Y]; if there is no synthesis, ks equals 0 and then

dY/dt = - [kd + kg] [Y] = - ka [Y]; where ka is the apparent decay rate therefore
View the MathML source

In a growing culture, we cannot measure directly kd. Instead we measured ka and kg, and calculated kd as ka-kg. To do this, we used strain TCY1, which expresses the chimeric transcription factor GEV (Louvion et al., 1993) and YFP under the control of the GAL1 promoter. The GEV transcription factor is composed of the Gal4 DNA binding domain, the estrogen receptor hormone binding domain and the VP16 activation domain. In this strain the GAL1 promoter is induced in the presence of estradiol, even in glucose containing medium and it is rapidly repressed when estradiol is subsequently removed.

Therefore, we added 100 nM estradiol to exponential (OD 0.3) TCY1 cultures that were growing in BSM 2% glucose. After 2h, we washed estradiol by filtration and allowed the cultures to grow for an extra 40 minutes; we think this delay allows for the YFP mRNA to decay and for the newly translated YFP to mature. After the 40 min delay, we collected and fixed samples every 15 minutes for 3h. Finally, we counted the number of cells and measured the average fluorescence intensity per pixel (the average intensity of all the pixels inside the cells in each field of view) by microscopy as described above. We subtracted autofluorescence (measured using cells grown in glucose medium in the absence of estradiol) and from these calculated ka and kg. In these conditions, ka was 0.014 min-1 (corresponding to an apparent half life of 49.5 min). In determining kg we assumed that in an asynchronous exponentially growing population, the rate of volume increase is equal to the rate of cell number increase. With this assumption kg was 7.7 × 10-3 min-1 (corresponding to a doubling time of 90 min). From this we get a kd of 6.3 × 10-3 min-1 (corresponding to a half life of 110 min).
Interaction Mating

We tested the interaction between LexA-Mob2 and Ace21-449 and Cbk1 in interaction mating two-hybrid experiments using the LexAop-lacZ reporter pSH18-34 essentially as described (Finley and Brent, 1994).
Analysis of Gene Expression Data

We obtained cell cycle (Spellman et al., 1998) and response to gene deletion (Hughes et al., 2000) gene expression data directly from (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/ and http://www.rii.com/tech/pubs/cell_hughes.htm). We clustered the raw data using the Cluster software (Eisen et al., 1998). We obtained data already clustered by the authors for the response of yeast to different environmental conditions (Gasch et al., 2000) from http://genome-www.stanford.edu/yeast_stress/.
