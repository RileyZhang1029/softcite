Life extension in Drosophila by neuronal over-expression of NF1 via combining the neuronal promoter ELAV-GAL4 line with the independent UAS-dNF1 transgenic lines (ELAV-GAL4/UAS-dNF1 ) versus the individual transgene heterozygotes (ELAV-GAL4/+ or UAS-dNF1/+ ).
Logrank test: P < 0.0001 for both males (a) and females (b), 6 experiments, 40 flies per experiment, 240 flies per category.
