Boot-strap analyses were conducted with the same software program, employing a full heuristic search with 500 replicates, a simple addition sequence, and TBR swap-ping (10 trees held at each step, MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on).

It applies ∆∆Ct method was used where ∆∆Ct =(Ct target gene, test sample - Ct endogenous control, test sample) - (Ct target gene, calibrator sample - Ct endogenous control, calibrator sample). Relative quanti- ties were corrected for efficiency of amplification and fold change in gene expression between groups was cal- culated as E-∆∆Ct ± s.e.m. Where more than one endo- genous control are used, fold change estimates were calculated using the geometric mean of EC quantities relative to the calibrator sample which could be the minimum, maximum or a named sample or an average.","qBasePlus"

This factor is calculated using the variable V as the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn + 1) between two sequential NFs (NFn and NFn + 1). To meet the recommended cut off V-value which is the point at which it is unnecessary to include additional genes in a normalisation strategy. The recommended limit for V value is 0.15 but it is not always achievable. In this instance, the GeNorm output file indicated that the optimal number of genes required for normalisation was three.","geNorm"
