Supplementary Fig. 3. Intact oxidative stress defense enzymes in NF1 mutants. a. & b. Total and
mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase activities were similar between NF1 mutant
and control mitochondria, mean Â± SD of 4 experiments, 400 flies per genotype (P = 0.32 for total SOD; P
= 0.98 for MnSOD, t - test; P = 0.64 for catalase).
