Supplementary Fig. 4. Life extension correlated with NF1 expression level. a. NF1
expression is increased in hsNF1/ +;K33 flies at 25oC. Western blots were used to
detect the 280kD NF1 protein. The NF1 level of hsNF1/+;K33 was greater than in K33 ,
while NF1 level of K33 was greater than the null mutant NF1 P1 . b. Similar increases in NF1
protein levels were generated by both the heat shock and GAL4-UAS systems, detected by
western blot measured using Image J densitometry analysis, mean ± SD of 3 experiments (*:
P < 0.05, t - test). c. Survivalship of hsNF1/+;K33 and control K33 flies at 18oC. Each data
point is the mean ± SD of 13 experiments with 40 flies per experiment, 520 flies total per
category. Both genotypes were maintained at 25oC throughout embryogenesis and 4 days into
adulthood before transfer to18oC. Flies were briefly exposed to room temperature (24oC to
25oC) for 15 minutes during food replacements every 4 days. No difference was observed in
maximal life spans (P = 0.783, t-test), though minimal differences were seen in mean life
spans (P = 0.024, Logrank test). NF1 levels in these flies were shown.
