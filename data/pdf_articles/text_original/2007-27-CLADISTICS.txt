Abstract
The systematic signiﬁcance of wood anatomical characters within Ericales is evaluated using separate and combined parsimony
analyses including 23 wood characters and 3945 informative molecular characters. Analyses of wood features alone result in poorly
resolved and conﬂicting topologies. However, when pedomorphic character states are coded as inapplicable, the combined bootstrap
topology results in an increase of resolution and support at most deeper nodes compared with the molecular analyses. This suggests
that phylogenetic information from the limited number of morphological characters is not completely swamped by an overwhelming
amount of molecular data. Based on the morphology of vessels and ﬁbers, and the distribution of axial parenchyma, two major
wood types can be distinguished within Ericales: (i) a ‘‘primitive’’ type, nearly identical to the wood structure in the more basal
outgroup Cornales, which is likely to have persisted in one major clade, and (ii) a ‘‘derived’’ type that must have evolved in at least
two separate evolutionary lines. The occurrence of the ﬁrst type is strongly correlated with shrubs to small trees growing in cold
temperate or tropical montane regions, while the second type is common in tall trees of tropical lowlands. This favors the inclusion
of ecologically adaptive features in phylogeny reconstruction.

History of Ericales: from morphology to molecules
Ericales, as recognized today, is a ﬂowering plant
order that includes about 11 500 species classiﬁed in 357
genera and, depending on the author, about 25 families
(Stevens, 2001 onwards; Anderberg et al., 2002; Bremer
et al., 2002; APG II, 2003; Barkman et al., 2004;
Kubitzki, 2004; Table 1). Geographic distribution patterns of the families are diverse: some are almost
cosmopolitan (e.g., Ericaceae and Myrsinaceae) or
pantropical (e.g., Ebenaceae, Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae), while others are restricted to the neotropics (e.g.,
Marcgraviaceae and Theophrastaceae) or concentrated
in more temperate regions (e.g., Clethraceae, Cyrillaceae
and Primulaceae) (Kubitzki, 2004). Representatives are
predominantly (sub)shrubs, trees and sometimes lianas.

Herbs comprise about 15% of the total number of
species and are mainly restricted to Balsaminaceae,
Diapensiaceae, Ericaceae, Mitrastemonaceae, Myrsinaceae, Primulaceae, Samolaceae and Sarraceniaceae (Stevens, 2001 onwards; Barkman et al., 2004; Kubitzki,
2004; Table 1).
In the premolecular era, the Ericales were a morphologically homogeneous group including only three
(Thorne, 1992) to eight families (Dahlgren, 1989). The
current position in the asterids and the extended
delimitation of the order is strongly supported by
molecular data, and ﬁnds its origin in the rbcL analysis
of Olmstead et al. (1992) who found a so-called ericalean clade consisting of Rhododendron (Ericaceae),
Fouquieria (Fouquieriaceae) and Polemonium (Polemoniaceae). The newly deﬁned Ericales clade rapidly
expanded since then. In 1993, a larger sampling of rbcL
sequence data resulted in an Ericales delimitation
that included various orders of Cronquist’s subclass
Dilleniidae, plus a few additional families such as

Balsaminaceae (Geraniales, Rosidae), Roridulaceae
(Rosales, Rosidae) and Polemoniaceae (Solanales,
Asteridae) (Table 1; Chase et al., 1993; Olmstead et al.,
1993). The idea of an enlarged Ericales complex was
further corroborated by analyses of: (i) more rbcL data
(Morton et al., 1996, 1997); (ii) nuclear DNA sequences
(Soltis et al., 1997); (iii) combined molecular and morphological data (Nandi et al., 1998); (iv) plastid and
nuclear DNA (Soltis et al., 2000; Albach et al., 2001);
(v) additional chloroplast sequences (Savolainen et al.,
2000; Bremer et al., 2002; Hilu et al., 2003); and (vi) a
combination of plastid and mitochondrial DNA
(Anderberg et al., 2002). It did not take much time
before the new Ericales were recognized in a formal
classiﬁcation by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group at the
base of the asterids (APG, 1998; APG II, 2003). In that
classiﬁcation, Cornales are the ﬁrst diverging asterid
clade followed by Ericales, which are sister to euasterids,
although in Hilu et al. (2003) the Cornales–Ericales
position is reversed. Since APG II, analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences have assigned the non-woody
holoparasite Mitrastema (Mitrastemonaceae) to the
Ericales (Barkman et al., 2004), and two additional
studies using plastid, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
have been published (Geuten et al., 2004; Scho¨nenberger et al., 2005).
Despite the strong molecular support for Ericales as a
whole, many interfamily relationships remain obscure.
However, recent phylogenetic analyses of molecular
data revealed some clades that are well corroborated:
balsaminoids (corresponding to Balsaminaceae, Marcgraviaceae, Tetrameristaceae) are sister to the rest of the
order, followed by Fouquieriaceae–Polemoniaceae that
in turn are sister to a large polytomy, including all other
ericalean families (Anderberg et al., 2002; Geuten et al.,
2004). In some analyses, Fouquieriaceae–Polemoniaceae
are part of the polytomy (Bremer et al., 2002; Scho¨nenberger et al., 2005). In this polytomy, ericoids (including
Actinidiaceae, Clethraceae, Cyrillaceae, Ericaceae, Roridulaceae and Sarraceniaceae) and primuloids (including
Maesaceae, Myrsinaceae, Primulaceae, Samolaceae and
Theophrastaceae) represent well-supported evolutionary
lines as well. The Bayesian analysis of Scho¨nenberger
et al. (2005) found an additional clade uniting ericoids,
Diapensiaceae, Styracaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae, but the taxonomic position of other families,
especially Lecythidaceae and Fouquieriaceae–Polemoniaceae, requires further study.
From a morphological point of view, the present
delimitation of Ericales is hard to understand because of
its huge heterogeneity. As a result, synapomorphies for
the order as a whole are diﬃcult to ﬁnd. Possible
examples are the simple leaves bearing single-veined
teeth with an opaque deciduous cap, gland or multicellular hair (theoid leaf teeth), and gynoecia with protruding diﬀuse placentae (Judd and Olmstead, 2004). Other

231

distinctive characters of Ericales in comparison with
other asterids are the presence of ellagic acid, and the
occurrence of ﬂowers usually with twice or more
as many stamens as the number of petals (versus
stamens equaling or fewer than the number of
petals in most other asterids), although reduction (e.g.,
Marcgraviaceae, Polemoniaceae) and increase (e.g.,
Lecythidaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae) in stamen
number has occurred within several ericalean families
(Judd et al., 2002; Smets and Pyck, 2003; Scho¨nenberger
et al., 2005). The huge morphological variation within
Ericales could be related to an early diversiﬁcation of
the order. It is remarkable that the oldest ericalean
fossils, minute ﬂower buds of Paleoenkianthus
(Ericaceae,  90 Myr), are among the oldest ones
known from the core eudicots (Nixon and Crepet,
1993; Dilcher, 2000; Crepet et al., 2004; Schneider et al.,
2004). Age estimates for Ericales based on molecular
data suggest even older values, ranging from about 130
to 110 Myr (Wikstro¨m et al., 2001, 2003; Bremer et al.,
2004). It is further estimated that the Ericales diversiﬁed
about 109–103 Myr, with almost all families present by
the early Eocene (50 Myr) (Sytsma et al., 2006).
Wood anatomy in cladistic analyses
Although it has repeatedly been demonstrated that
wood features represent an important source of phylogenetic information that needs to be considered in
systematic studies (Herendeen, 1996; Baas et al., 2000;
Herendeen and Miller, 2000; Carlquist, 2001a; Olson,
2005), relatively few authors have included wood
features in broader morphological cladistic studies of
angiosperms (e.g., Loconte and Stevenson, 1991;
Anderberg, 1992; Huﬀord, 1992; Keller et al., 1996;
Nandi et al., 1998; Ka˚rehed et al., 1999; Ka˚rehed,
2001; Luna and Ochoterena, 2004). Furthermore, the
number of anatomists who have incorporated their
observations in phylogenetic analyses is limited (e.g.,
Baas et al., 1988; Zhang, 1992; Gasson, 1994, 1996;
Noshiro and Baas, 1998; Klaassen, 1999; Olson, 2002;
Male´cot et al., 2004). The limited use of wood
anatomical characters in phylogenetic analyses of
angiosperms likely is caused by an insuﬃcient knowledge of microscopic wood structure among many
plant systematists. In addition, phylogenetic analyses of
morphological features have to cope with some generally known problems, such as subjectivity in character
choice and character coding, the often unfavorable
ratio between the number of features and taxa studied,
the presence of polymorphisms within taxa, and the
occurrence of continuously varying characters (Nixon
and Davis, 1991; Stevens, 1991; Wilkinson, 1992, 1995;
Thiele, 1993; Pleijel, 1995; Kornet and Turner, 1999;
Strong and Lipscomb, 1999; Herendeen and Miller,
2000; Hillis and Wiens, 2000; Wiens, 2001). Some

232

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

authors even take the view that the role of morphology
in phylogenetic analyses should be a minor one by
stating that ‘‘rigorous and critical anatomical studies of
fewer morphological characters in the context of a
molecular phylogeny is the way that integrated studies
will and should develop’’ (Scotland et al., 2003).
Reaction to this view soon followed, and elaborate
counter-examples have been cited in subsequent papers
(e.g., Jenner, 2004; Wiens, 2004). Indeed, most of the
problems related to morphological analyses are also
true for molecular data. In addition, many authors
have demonstrated the systematic usefulness of morphological data in phylogenetic analyses, especially
when combining morphological characters with
molecular ones (e.g., Nixon and Carpenter, 1996;
Pennington, 1996; Kress et al., 2001; Evans et al.,
2003; Lee, 2004).
Wood structure is inﬂuenced by macroclimatic
conditions, diﬀerences in life forms, and the eﬀect of
pedomorphism, and this needs to be considered in
comparative wood anatomical studies. Ecological
trends in wood have been investigated in numerous
studies, and can be generalized as follows: (i) vessel
element length and vessel diameter decrease from wet
to dry regions and from tropical to cool temperate or
arctic latitudes, while the reverse is true for vessel
density; (ii) a high degree of vessel grouping and the
occurrence of vasicentric tracheids are most common
in arid ﬂoras; and (iii) prominent helical thickenings
are most abundant in Mediterranean and temperate
ﬂoras (van der Graaﬀ and Baas, 1974; van den Oever
et al., 1981; Carlquist, 1985, 2001a; Baas, 1986b;
Dickison, 2000; Noshiro and Baas, 2000; Baas et al.,
2003). The functional signiﬁcance of some of these
trends is not yet completely understood, such as helical
sculpturing and vessel element length, but other trends
can be explained by the interaction between two
assumingly opposite aspects of water transport in
plants: eﬃciency and safety. For example, species
growing in arctic to cold temperate climates frequently
undergo freeze–thaw cycles, which may result in the
formation of air bubbles in the water column (embolisms), and this seriously reduces water transport. As
vessels with a narrow diameter are less vulnerable to
freezing-induced embolism, plants from cold climates
will opt for wood that is characterized by narrow
vessels with scalariform perforations as this provides a
safe (but less eﬃcient) water transport system. On the
other hand, wider vessels with simple perforations are
more abundant in warm and dry areas, in which
moments of peak transport are needed (cf. Hagen–
Poiseuille’s law). Accordingly, tropical lowland species
with typically high transpiration rates have a more
eﬃcient (but less safe) water transport mechanism than
species from colder climates (Baas, 1976; Zimmermann, 1983; Sperry et al., 1994; Ellerby and Ennos,

1998; Davis et al., 1999; Schulte, 1999; Feild and
Brodribb, 2001).
Some of the ecologically adaptive characters mentioned above may also have a correlation with habit.
Small shrubs are characterized by many narrow vessels
showing a high percentage of scalariform perforations,
while a low frequency of relatively wide vessels with
simple perforations are typical of tall trees (Baas, 1976;
Carlquist and Hoekman, 1985; Baas and Schweingruber, 1987; Dickison, 2000; Carlquist, 2001a; Lens et al.,
2004c). Also lianas are characterized by among others
large mean vessel diameters and an increased abundance
of axial parenchyma. The wider vessels result in a higher
water conduction capacity that is required to provide
suﬃcient water transport through the relatively narrow
liana stems, and the abundant axial parenchyma provides more ﬂexibility to the stem in order to protect the
water column (Carlquist, 1989a). There are also other
wood characters that can be linked to habit, such as
multiseriate ray width and height, but these correlations
are often poorer (Lens et al., 2004c, in press).
In some ericalean families, such as Balsaminaceae
(Janssens et al., 2006) and Myrsinaceae (Ka¨llersjo¨ et al.,
2000; Lens et al., 2005a), at least some woody taxa are
known to have evolved from herbaceous ancestors,
which in turn originated from primarily woody ancestors. So, these woody taxa have secondarily derived
wood, which can be characterized by one or more
indicators of pedomorphism or neoteny. Pedomorphism
in wood is deﬁned as the phenomenon in which
‘‘juvenile characteristics—those of the primary xylem—have been protracted into the secondary xylem [ ¼
wood]’’ (Carlquist, 1962, p. 31). Examples of these
indicators are the constant decrease of vessel element
length from the pith towards the cambium, the occurrence of wide scalariform intervessel pitting, and the
absence of rays or the presence of exclusively upright
cells in multiseriate rays (Carlquist, 1962).
Previous studies in Ericales have revealed that wood
characters generally agree with molecular phylogenies at
the (sub)family level, such as Ericaceae (Lens et al.,
2003, 2004a,b), Lecythidaceae (Lens et al., in press),
Marcgraviaceae (Lens et al., 2005b) and Theophrastaceae (Lens et al., 2005a). Here, we evaluate the phylogenetic value of wood anatomical characters at the
ordinal level, using the results of our earlier studies
together with data from literature and additional
personal observations. In total, 23 wood characters are
used and combined with the molecular matrix of
Scho¨nenberger et al. (2005) (hereinafter SEA), including
in total 3945 parsimony informative molecular characters from chloroplast, mitochondrial as well as nuclear
origin. The objectives of this study are: (i) to provide an
overview of the wood anatomical diversity within
Ericales sensu APG II (2003); (ii) to demonstrate the
systematic value of wood features, with particular

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

emphasis on ecologically adaptive features, variation in
life forms, neoteny and continuously varying characters;
(iii) to trace evolutionary patterns of selected wood
anatomical characters; and (iv) to assess the impact of a
wood anatomical data set combined with a molecular
data set that has orders of magnitude more characters.

Materials and methods
Material and microtechniques
In order to provide an overview of the wood
anatomical diversity within Ericales, personal observations were carried out on 529 samples using light
microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Lens, 2005; Appendix 2). Ninety-ﬁve percent of
the samples studied were derived from balsaminoids
(Lens et al., 2005b), Ebenaceae, Ericaceae (Lens et al.,
2003, 2004a,b,c), Lecythidaceae, primuloids (Lens et al.,
2005a), and Sapotaceae. Information from the other
families was primarily based on comprehensive wood
anatomical papers, and only few wood samples from
each family were investigated to verify the literature
data (Lechner, 1914; Cox, 1948a,b; Metcalfe and Chalk,
1950; Thomas, 1960; Carlquist, 1976, 1984, 1988, 1989b,
2001a,b; Giebel and Dickison, 1976; DeBuhr, 1977;
Kukachka, 1978–82; van den Oever et al., 1981; Carlquist et al., 1984; Dickison and Phend, 1985; Gregory,
1988; Suzuki and Noshiro, 1988; de Zeeuw, 1990; Liang
and Baas, 1990, 1991; Budi, 1993; Morton, 1994;
Noshiro and Baas, 1998). Information on aluminum
accumulation in wood was gathered from Jansen et al.
(2004b) and new observations. The anatomical data for
the outgroup genera Aucuba, Cornus, Ilex and Hydrangea were taken from Baas (1973), Stern (1978) and
Noshiro and Baas (1998), and complemented with
observations from InsideWood (2004 onwards).
Wood sections, about 25 lm thick, were cut using a
sledge microtome (Reichert, Vienna, Austria). After
sectioning, the tissues were bleached with sodium
hypochlorite and stained with a mixture of safranin
and alcian blue (35 : 65). The safranin was prepared as
a 1% solution in 50% ethanol. The 1% alcian blue
stain was dissolved in pure water. Afterwards, the
sections were dehydrated with 50–75–96% ethanol and
mounted in euparal. Macerations were made according
to Franklin (1945). Observations were carried out using
a Dialux 20 light microscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany). Pictures were taken using DP50-CU digital
camera (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Wood sections for SEM observations were gold-coated with a
sputter coater (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, USA)
and observed using a JEOL JSM-5800 LV and a JEOL
JSM-6360 scanning electron microscope (JEOL Ltd,
Tokyo, Japan).

Wood characters
The wood anatomical terminology follows the IAWA
list of microscopic features for hardwood identiﬁcation
(IAWA Committee, 1989). Because of the incongruence
between the deﬁnitions of Baas (1986a) and Carlquist
(2001a) for types of imperforate tracheary elements, we
prefer to give a detailed description of these cells
(Appendix 1). For all quantitative data on tracheary
elements, 25 measurements from macerations were
made. When distinctly bordered vessel-ray pits are
mentioned, we mean that the pit pairs are half-bordered,
because the pit on the vessel side is bordered, but
predominantly simple on the parenchyma cell side.
The selection of characters is based on their variation
within the order and their stability at generic level
(Appendix 1), and is partly similar to the ones proposed
by Herendeen and Miller (2000). Highly variable characters in Ericales with no clear distinction between
character states at the genus level were expelled from the
analysis (e.g., distinctness of growth rings, porosity,
occurrence of pit membrane remnants, presence of two
distinct ray sizes, and incidence of sheath cells). The
presence of breakdown ray areas, i.e., cavities in rays
caused by disintegration of neighboring ray cells (Lens
et al., 2005a), was also excluded because it is autapomorphic for the genus Myrsine (other Myrsinaceae genera
that also develop this feature are not included in the
matrix). In addition, only one of two dependent characters was taken into account: vessel diameter ⁄ density,
vessel element ⁄ ﬁber length, and uniseriate ⁄ multiseriate
ray height. Likewise, the number of bars per perforation
plate was not included because families with exclusively
scalariform perforations often show many bars (30 or
more), while taxa with mixed simple and scalariform
plates have considerably fewer bars (1–10) (cf. Herendeen and Miller, 2000).
Features that often are correlated with ecological
factors, such as vessel perforation plate (char. 2), vessel
element length (char. 3), vessel diameter (char. 4), vessel
density (not included), helical thickenings (char. 8) and
vasicentric tracheids (char. 9) were incorporated in the
matrix (Appendix 1). The inclusion of ecologically
adaptive features should not necessarily be rejected
a priori. Luckow and Bruneau (1997, p. 147) stated
‘‘although ecological characters may be dependent to
varying degrees on ecological or [evolutionary] adaptive
processes, this does not in itself aﬀect their reliability as
indicators of phylogenetic relationship’’. This is further
supported among others by Jansen et al. (2001, 2004a)
and Baas et al. (2003), who discussed examples of
ecologically adaptive wood features with a strong
phylogenetic signal. In order to evaluate the impact of
diﬀerent climatic conditions, seven ecotype categories
were deﬁned based on the SEA matrix: (i) temperate to
tropical (sub)montane; (ii) tropical (sub)montane;

(sub)montane; and (vii) warm arid (Figs 1 and 4).
Lowland regions are lower than 500 m, while montane
areas have an elevation above 1000 m (including the
Guyana Highlands).
Characters that are known to be often correlated with
life forms are vessel perforation plate (char. 2), vessel
element length (char. 3) and vessel diameter (char. 4)
(Appendix 1). Three habit groups were recognized to
investigate the inﬂuence of this phenomenon: (i) shrubs

to small trees (< 15 m); (ii) tall trees; (> 15 m); and
(iii) lianas (Figs 1 and 4).
Some characters used in the analysis, such as
extremely short vessel elements (char. 3 states 0–1), the
occurrence of wide scalariform intervessel pits (char. 5
state 0), and the absence of rays or the presence of
exclusively upright cells in multiseriate rays (char. 17
state 2), usually are indicators of pedomorphism or
neoteny (Carlquist, 1962). In the present study, pedomorphic wood is known for species in the genus
Empetrum (Carlquist, 1989b), Impatiens (Lens et al.,

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

2005b) and Lysimachia (Lens et al., 2005a), and most
likely also in the genera Cobaea (Carlquist et al., 1984),
Heliamphora and Sarracenia (DeBuhr, 1977). In order
to explore the inﬂuence of pedomorphism in our matrix,
we have chosen to analyze a second wood matrix with
non-applicable character states for every pedomorphic
character state in these genera (cf. Wiens et al., 2005).
As the impact of pedomorphism in wood can diﬀer
among taxa, the number of non-applicable character
states for pedomorphic taxa varies: Cobaea (chars 3, 15–
17), Empetrum (chars 3, 5–6, 15–17), Heliamphora (chars
5–6, 17), Impatiens (chars 3, 5–6, 12, 15–17), Lysimachia
(chars 3, 12, 15–17) and Sarracenia (char. 17) (Appendix
1).
Out of the 23 wood characters used in the matrix, ﬁve
are continuously varying (chars 3, 4, 6, 15 and 16; see
Appendix 1) and coded following the gap weighting
method of Thiele (1993) with a maximum of 10 diﬀerent
character states. This method considers the order and
distribution of the mean values for a certain character

235

(determined as the mean value for all available species’
means within one genus) and converts them to ordered,
multistate characters. The distance between the means is
represented by the distance between the ordered character states in the matrix. As ordered characters with 10
states would overestimate the importance of the continuous characters in the analysis, we have compensated
this by assigning a weight of 0.1 to these characters. This
weighting would imply that the continuous characters
are equivalent to the binary characters if homoplasy is
absent, but they would not be equivalent to the
multistate characters. Therefore, the weight of the
continuous characters is increased in separate analyses
(Table 2). The statistical tests were performed using
MorphoCode, an open-source software program that
implements the gap weighting method (Schols et al.,
2004). In addition, we have chosen to order ﬁve discrete
characters (chars 1, 2, 5, 14 and 17), because numerous
large-scale wood studies in angiosperms have demonstrated intermediate states in these characters (Bailey

Cladistic analyses
The taxon sampling in this study is based on the
molecular matrix of SEA, although some adjustments
are made. In our analyses, the second SEA terminal of
the genera Fouquieria, Shortia and Symplocos was
deleted. Laplacea is removed from our analyses, as this
genus is submerged within Gordonia (Kubitzki, 2004).
The genus Monotheca is a synonym of Sideroxylon
(Kubitzki, 2004). As a result, 59 of the 63 taxa that were
included in the SEA study are retained. This implies that
the number of informative characters in the original
SEA study slightly diﬀers from our study (3914 versus
3945, respectively). Of the 59 taxa included, seven are
herbaceous, so wood characters were coded as inapplicable for Chimaphila (Ericaceae), Diapensia (Diapensiaceae),
Galax
(Diapensiaceae),
Polemonium
(Polemoniaceae), Primula (Primulaceae), Samolus (Samolaceae) and Shortia (Diapensiaceae). The genera
Aucuba (Garryaceae, Garryales, euasterid I), Cornus
(Cornaceae, Cornales, basal asterids), Hydrangea
(Hydrangeaceae, Cornales, basal asterids) and Ilex
(Aquifoliaceae, Aquifoliales, euasterid II) form the
outgroup.
In the combined analysis, 23 informative wood
characters (Appendix 1) were analyzed in combination
with the molecular matrix of the SEA study including
19 768 characters of which 3945 characters are potentially parsimony informative. The sequence data are
derived from the chloroplast (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL,
rps16, trnT-F and trnv-atpE), mitochondrial (atp1 and
matR) and nuclear DNA (18S and 26S). In order to
assess the impact of a small number of morphological
characters (n ¼ 23) on a molecular data set comprising
orders of magnitude more parsimony informative characters (n ¼ 3945), we carried out an analysis with nonapplicable character states for all 23 wood characters
(ANAL 7). Diﬀerences in bootstrap values between the
latter analysis and the combined analysis will be
discussed.
In order to evaluate our search strategy, we ﬁrst
analyzed the original SEA matrix using PAUP*4.0b10
(Swoﬀord, 2002) to compare our trees with the SEA
topologies. As both analyses resulted in identical trees,
the following search strategy was chosen: stepwise
addition of 100 random taxa sequences, followed by
Tree Bisection-Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping
(100 trees held at each step during the stepwise addition,
MULTREES on, STEEPEST DESCENT on). Bootstrap analyses were conducted with the same software
program, employing a full heuristic search with 500
replicates, a simple addition sequence, and TBR swapping (10 trees held at each step, MULTREES on,

STEEPEST DESCENT on). The consensus of the
bootstrap replicates was used to determine bootstrap
values.
The search strategy of the wood matrix was adjusted
because of excessive computational time to run the
analysis to completion. Therefore, MULTREES option
was turned oﬀ, and a heuristic search using 1000 instead
of 100 replicates was carried out. Furthermore, a
topological constraint tree had to be postulated in
which the ingroup was forced to be monophyletic.
The ﬁnal cladogram ﬁgures were made using
MacClade 4.04 (Maddison and Maddison, 2005) and
edited with Adobe InDesign CS. As some of the
branches in the bootstrap consensus tree are not highly
supported, we chose to code uncertainties in character
evolution as equivocal. In addition, the option ‘‘soft
polytomies’’ was used.
A total number of 14 analyses are performed in this
study (ANAL 1–14; Table 2). Each analysis represents
an adjustment compared with the original analysis in
order to assess the impact of the continuous, ecological
and pedomorphic characters.

Results
Wood analyses (ANAL, 1–5; Fig. 1)
A parsimony analysis of the original wood matrix
resulted in 11 equally parsimonious trees with a length
of 118.6 steps (ANAL 1) [all characters are parsimony
informative; consistency index (CI) ¼ 0.27; retention
index (RI) ¼ 0.72]. The strict consensus tree (Fig. 1A)
strongly deviates from the molecular phylogenies and
most families prove to be para- or polyphyletic, except
for Marcgraviaceae, Sapotaceae, Styracaceae and Tetrameristaceae. An early diverging clade includes Styracaceae plus Sladenia followed by a large polytomy. Within
this large polytomy, several clades can be recognized,
such as Impatiens–Empetrum–Heliamphora–Ficalhoa–
Camellia–Gordonia, Roridula–Sarracenia, Acanthogilia–
Cobaea,
Fouquieriaceae–Lecythidaceae–Ebenaceae,
Cantua–Sapotaceae, and primuloids(PR)–balsaminoids(BA) (without the pedomorphic genera Impatiens
and Lysimachia). A bootstrap analysis gives a poorly
resolved polytomy (not shown) in which only Marcgraviaceae (83), Sapotaceae without Sarcosperma (81),
Tetramerista–Pentamerista (79), Barringtonia–Couroupita (80) and Roridula–Sarracenia (54) form a clade. If
the weight of continuous characters is increased to 0.5,
resolution of the strict consensus tree increases (topology not shown; ANAL 2): Styracaceae–Ficalhoa–Sladenia, Schima–Gordonia, and Roridula–Heliamphora–
Empetrum–Sarracenia form early diverging clades,
followed by Lecythidaceae–Sapotaceae–Ebenaceae, which
is sister to primuloids–balsaminoids–Polemoniaceae

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

(without Acanthogilia). Exclusion of the continuous
characters (topology not shown; ANAL 3) results in a
less resolved topology in which only balsaminoids
(without Impatiens) and Sapotaceae are monophyletic.
When pedomorphic character states are coded as nonapplicable, parsimony analyses ﬁnd 38 most
parsimonious trees with a length of 106.9 (ANAL 4)
(CI ¼ 0.28, RI ¼ 0.75). The strict consensus topology
(not shown) is somewhat diﬀerent from Fig. 1A: the ﬁrst
diverging lineages are all unresolved, but in the last
diverging clades Fouquieriaceae–Lecythidaceae–Ebenaceae are sister to a large clade consisting of balsaminoids, primuloids, Sapotaceae and Cantua. Within the
last diverging group, only Marcgraviaceae, Sapotaceae
and Tetrameristaceae are monophyletic. These three
families are also corroborated by bootstrap support
values: Marcgraviaceae (76), Sapotaceae (82) and Tetrameristaceae (58).
If the pedomorphic taxa are excluded from the wood
analysis, heuristic searches ﬁnd 38 most parsimonious
trees with 105.0 steps (ANAL 5) (CI ¼ 0.30, RI ¼ 0.73).
The strict consensus (Fig. 1B) resembles Fig. 1A in the
later diverging groups. In addition, there is another
large clade uniting all genera of ericoids, Pentaphylacaceae (without Sladenia), Symplocaceae, and Theaceae
plus the genus Acanthogilia. The bootstrap consensus
tree (not shown) resembles the poorly resolved polytomy
found in the original analysis.
Molecular analyses (ANAL, 6–7; Figs 2A and 3)
The analysis of the slightly adjusted SEA matrix
(ANAL 6), including 59 taxa and 3945 informative
characters, results in 101 equally parsimonious trees
with length 14 899 (CI ¼ 0.43, RI ¼ 0.52). The strict
consensus tree (Fig. 2A) is similar to strict consensus
topology of the combined analyses (Fig. 2B) and to the
parsimony topology in SEA: balsaminoids are sister to a
large polytomy, including Ebenaceae–primuloids, ericoids, Fouquieriaceae–Polemoniaceae, Lecythidaceae,
Pentaphylacaceae, Sapotaceae, Styracaceae–Diapensiaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae. The only diﬀerence
with the SEA strict consensus tree is that the taxonomic
position of Symplocaceae is unresolved in our analysis
(probably because Symplocos is only included once in our
study), and that Actinidia–Roridula and Heliamphora–
Sarracenia are not resolved as sisters. The Bayesian
analysis of SEA (Fig. 3a) shows several additional
clades within the large polytomy, such as Sapotaceae–
Ebenaceae–primuloids (clade III) and ericoids–Symplocaceae–Theaceae–Styracaceae–Diapensiaceae. Likewise, the bootstrap consensus tree of ANAL 6 shows
these two clades as well, plus an additional relationship
between Lecythidaceae and Polemoniaceae–Fouquieriaceae (59) (Fig. 3B). Within ericoids, Actinidia–Roridula
and Heliamphora–Sarracenia form a clade (68) that is

237

fully supported as sister to the other genera. The strict
and the bootstrap consensus trees of our molecular
analyses are nearly identical to the trees based on the
same matrix plus 23 non-applicable characters (topologies not shown; ANAL 7).
Combined analyses of the molecular ⁄ original wood matrix
(ANAL 8–10; Figs 2B and 3B)
A parsimony analysis of the combined matrix
revealed 41 most parsimonious trees with a length of
15 063.7 steps (ANAL 8) (3968 characters are
parsimony-informative, CI ¼ 0.42, RI ¼ 0.52). The
strict consensus tree of ANAL 8 (cf. Fig. 2B; clades
indicated by double arrows collapse) is nearly identical
to Fig. 2A, except for Lecythidaceae–(Fouquieriaceae–
Polemoniaceae), and Ebenaceae–primuloids. The bootstrap topology of ANAL 8 strongly resembles the
molecular bootstrap topology (ANAL 6; cf. Fig. 3B).
There is also some evidence for one additional clade:
Pentaphylacaceae are sister to ericoids, Theaceae and
Symplocaceae–Styracaceae–Diapensiaceae (61) forming
clade IV (Fig. 3B). The bootstrap support values of the
combined data are slightly higher or lower than the
values based on molecular data only (Fig. 3B).
If the same analysis is carried out without the ﬁve
continuous characters (chars 3, 4, 6, 15, 16; ANAL 9),
the sister relationship between Lecythidaceae and Fouquieriaceae–Polemoniaceae disappears in the strict consensus tree (not shown). The bootstrap topologies of the
analyses including ⁄ excluding the continuous data
remain the same, but two clades in ANAL 9 receive a
slightly higher support value compared with ANAL 8:
clade II (65 versus 59) and clade III (66 versus 57).
The consideration of ﬁve ordered, non-continuous
wood characters into unordered characters (chars 1, 2,
5, 14, 17; ANAL 10) leads again to the disappearance
of the relationship between Lecythidaceae and
Fouquieriaceae–Polemoniaceae in the strict consensus
tree (topology not shown). The bootstrap topology and
support values are very similar to the original combined
analysis (Fig. 3B): only clade II receives greater support
(67 versus 59).
Combined analyses of the molecular ⁄ non-pedomorphic
wood matrix (ANAL 11–14; Figs 2B and 3B)
When the pedomorphic character states are not taken
into account (cf. Wiens et al., 2005), 17 most parsimonious trees are found with a length of 15 046.3 (ANAL
11; CI ¼ 0.42, RI ¼ 0.52). The strict consensus tree of
this analysis (Fig. 2B) is similar to the one of the original
combined matrix (ANAL 8), and shows improved
resolution for the relationships of Impatiens, Ebenaceae–primuloids, and Actinidia–Roridula–Heliamphora–
Sarracenia (double arrows in Fig. 2B). The bootstrap

topology of the original combined analysis (ANAL 8),
but a slight increase of support values for the already
established clades can be seen in comparison with the
original combined analysis: clade II (69 versus 59), clade

III (65 versus 57), and Actinidia–Roridula–Heliamphora–

and
Fouquieriaceae–Polemoniaceae,
and
between Ebenaceae and primuloids in the strict
consensus tree (topology not shown). Furthermore,
the Actinidia–Roridula–Heliamphora–Sarracenia clade
falls apart into Actinidia–Roridula and Heliamphora–
Sarracenia, and falls outside ericoids. The bootstrap

topology of ANAL 13 shows similar relationships as
in Fig. 3B. Nevertheless, some of the bootstrap values
are higher than in ANAL 11: Pentaphylacaceae
(83 versus 76), and clade IV without Pentaphylacaceae
(74 versus 67).
If only the continuous characters are considered
ordered (ANAL 14), the strict consensus tree (not

shown) is nearly identical to Fig. 2B, except for the
Actinidia–Roridula–Heliamphora–Sarracenia relationship, and the resolved position of Symplocos as sister
to Styracaceae–Diapensiaceae. Also the bootstrap
topology of ANAL 14 (not shown) is very similar,
except for the bootstrap values that are somewhat lower
compared with ANAL 11 (Fig. 3B).

Discussion
Wood-based analyses
The analyses of the wood matrix alone ﬁnd trees that
largely contradict our current molecular-based insights
in the phylogeny of Ericales. Furthermore, the majority
of the families in the wood analysis do not appear
monophyletic in the strict consensus topology (Fig. 1A),
while several molecular studies have demonstrated the
opposite (e.g., Anderberg et al., 2002; Scho¨nenberger
et al., 2005). The few families that can be delimited by a
unique combination of wood features are Marcgraviaceae [Lens et al., 2005b; vasicentric axial parenchyma
(char. 13 state 2), high and wide multiseriate rays with
heterocellular body ray cells (chars 15 state 6, 16 states
3–6, 17 state 1), and raphides (char. 19 state 1)],
Tetrameristaceae [Lens et al., 2005b; thick ﬁber walls
(char. 12 state 1), combination of apotracheal and
paratracheal axial parenchyma (char. 13 states 0 and 2),
and raphides (char. 19 state 1)], and Sapotaceae
[Kukachka, 1978–82; thick ﬁber walls (char. 12 state 1),
banded axial parenchyma (char. 13 state 1), narrow and
low multiseriate rays (chars 15 state 0, 16 state 0), and
crystal sand (char. 21 state 1)].
One explanation oﬀered for poorly resolved wood
phylogenies is that there is an overwhelming amount of
noise in a wood matrix (Baas et al., 1988; Zhang, 1992;
Noshiro and Baas, 1998; Klaassen, 1999). The deviating
wood topologies can be largely attributed to the
correlation of the wood structure with (macro)climatic
conditions, and this is most pronounced in vessel
characters (chars 2, 3, 4, 8). It frequently has been
discussed that similar ecological factors result in convergent wood anatomical trends and—to a lesser
extent—in reversals that hamper the search for evolutionary relationships (Baas and Wheeler, 1996). The
impact of these trends becomes obvious when the
distribution area of the ericalean families is investigated:
Fig. 1 shows that nearly all families growing in
(sub)tropical lowland regions are part of one clade
comprising balsaminoids, primuloids, Ebenaceae,
Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae (largely corresponding
to clades I and III in Fig. 3B), together with the more
xeromorphic Fouquieriaceae and the ecological more
variable Polemoniaceae (corresponding to clade II in
Fig. 3B). Ecologically adaptive features that character-

241

ize this large group are relatively wide vessels that are
100 lm or more in tangential diameter (char. 4 states 5–
9) and simple perforations (char. 2 state 2), two features
of which especially the former contributes to the
eﬃciency of water transport (Zimmermann, 1983; Ellerby and Ennos, 1998; Schulte, 1999). This contrasts
with the narrower vessels (char. 4 states 0–4) having
scalariform perforations (char. 2 state 0) and helical
thickenings (char. 8 state 1) that deﬁne clade IV.
Representatives of the latter clade generally grow in
(sub)tropical montane to more temperate or even
boreal–arctic areas in which high rates of water
conduction are not needed, so a safe xylem transport
prevails over an eﬃcient transport (e.g., Baas, 1976;
Zimmermann, 1983; Feild and Brodribb, 2001). The
clear ecological trends notwithstanding, clade IV is
supported in the total evidence bootstrap topologies
(Fig. 3B) and also—to a large extent—in the Bayesian
topology of SEA (Fig. 3A), while the tropical lowland
clades I–III form at least two evolutionary lines
(Fig. 3B). Furthermore, exclusion of the ecologically
adaptive features (ANAL 12) results in a loss of
resolution in the strict consensus trees and a decrease
of bootstrap values among the major evolutionary lines.
This indicates that ecologically adaptive features possess
a supplementary phylogenetic signal, i.e., the adaptation
from temperate or tropical montane Cornales-like
ancestors towards tropical lowland Ericales lineages
prove to coincide with cladogenesis, and therefore these
features should not be excluded a priori in phylogenetic
analyses (cf. Luckow and Bruneau, 1997).
In addition to the ecological impact, wood anatomical
features also vary with plant habit (Baas, 1976; Carlquist
and Hoekman, 1985; Baas and Schweingruber, 1987;
Dickison, 2000; Carlquist, 2001a; Lens et al., 2004c).
This might explain why Polemoniaceae (shrubs and
vines; Fig. 1) are not reconstructed as a monophyletic
group in the wood-based phylogeny (Fig. 1), and appear
not to be closely related to Fouquieriaceae (shrubs to
columnar stem succulents; Kubitzki, 2004), despite a
strong molecular relationship between both families.
Parsimony analysis of ANAL 1 (Fig. 1A) shows
another suprafamily clade that corresponds well to
molecular phylogenies: balsaminoids (without Impatiens). The presence of septate ﬁbers (char. 11 state 1),
mainly paratracheal axial parenchyma (char. 13 state 2),
high multiseriate rays (char. 16 states 6–9), and the
presence of raphides in rays (char. 19 state 1) corroborate their monophyletic origin (Lens et al., 2005b). It is
not surprising that Impatiens does not belong to the
balsaminoids in the wood analyses, as the few woody
Impatiens species are secondarily woody. The secondarily derived wood in Impatiens is very clear because of
several deviating pedomorphic features: the constant
decrease of vessel element length with age (char. 3 state
0), very wide scalariform vessel pits (char. 5 state 0; char.

242

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

6 state 9), and extremely wide (char. 15 state 9) and high
multiseriate rays (char. 16 state 9) with exclusively
upright ray cells (char. 17 state 2) (Lens et al., 2005b).
Figure 1A shows two additional examples of the
misleading eﬀect of pedomorphism on phylogeny reconstruction: (i) the genus Lysimachia is not associated with
the other primuloids, and (ii) Empetrum (Ericacaceae) is
part of a clade, including two other pedomorphic taxa:
Impatiens and Heliamphora. These peculiar relationships
provide evidence for the hypothesis of Carlquist (1962,
p. 44) who stated that ‘‘Phylesis both toward or away
from herbaceousness would involve juvenile expressions,
so these could not be used as criteria of one ancestry or
the other’’. Also Wiens et al. (2005, p. 100) commented
on the eﬀect of pedomorphosis in his evolutionary study
of salamanders: ‘‘the analysis of pedomorphic species
can be problematic because of the absence of cladespeciﬁc adult traits that would allow their correct
placement, rather than just the misleading presence of
larval traits shared among all pedomorphic species’’.
If the pedomorphic taxa are excluded from the wood
matrix, two large clades appear that correspond well to
macroclimatic zones (Fig. 1B): (i) a largely (sub)tropical
lowland clade (corresponding to clades I–III in Fig. 3B,
except for Acanthogilia), deﬁned by a so-called derived
set of wood features in the Baileyan sense [i.e., distinct
vessel multiples (char. 1 states 1–2), simple perforations
(char. 2 state 2), alternate intervessel pitting (char. 5
state 4), ﬁbers with simple to minutely bordered pits
(char. 10 state 0), and paratracheal or banded apotracheal axial parenchyma (char. 13 states 1–2)], and (ii) a
(sub)tropical montane to more temperate ⁄ boreal clade
(comparable with clade IV in Fig. 3B, except for
Styracaceae and Sladenia), which can be characterized
by a so-called primitive Baileyan syndrome of wood
features [solitary vessels (char. 1 state 0), scalariform
perforations (char. 2 state 0), mainly opposite to
scalariform vessel pitting (char. 5 states 0–2), ﬁbers with
distinctly bordered pits (char. 10 state 1), and diﬀuse or
diﬀuse-in-aggregates axial parenchyma (char. 13 state
0)] (Bailey and Tupper, 1918; Kribs, 1937; Fig. 4). From
a wood anatomical point of view, it is understandable
that Styracaceae and Sladenia fall outside the two large
clades: they share many features with the second clade
(Fig. 4), but there are also links with the ﬁrst clade, such
as distinct vessel multiples (char. 1 states 1–2) and the
tendency to alternate intervessel pitting (char. 5 states
3–4) (Dickison and Phend, 1985; Liang and Baas, 1990).
The recognition of balsaminoids in Fig. 1A together
with the so-called primitive wood clade in Fig. 1B
demonstrates that wood anatomical features include
phylogenetic signals that can deﬁne large evolutionary
lines within Ericales. This corroborates the ﬁndings of
various wood studies in Ericales at the family ⁄ tribal
level that have demonstrated the systematic usefulness
of wood characters in diﬀerent families (Lens et al.,

2003, 2004a,b, 2005a,b, in press), primuloids (Lens
et al., 2005a) and balsaminoids (Lens et al., 2005b). The
systematic signiﬁcance of wood anatomy is not only
restricted to Ericales, but has also been demonstrated in
many other dicotyledonous groups (e.g., Oleaceae: Baas
et al., 1988; Sapindaceae: Klaassen, 1999; eudicots:
Jansen et al., 2001; Moringaceae: Olson, 2002).
Combined analyses
The inclusion of morphological and molecular data in
a combined analysis is widely accepted and encouraged
by most systematists, because it generally presents the
best way to unravel the phylogeny of a speciﬁc group,
even if the number of informative morphological characters is swamped by molecular ones (Nixon and
Carpenter, 1996; Pennington, 1996; Ka˚rehed, 2001;
Kress et al., 2001; Evans et al., 2003; Lee, 2004). In
the present study, the small morphological data set has a
clear impact on phylogeny reconstruction, indicated by
diﬀerences between the combined versus molecular
topologies. For example, the strict consensus tree of
combined non-pedomorphic analysis (ANAL 11) shows
an increased resolution compared with the molecular
analysis (ANAL 6) in the relationship of Impatiens,
clade II, and Actinidia–Roridula and Heliamphora–
Sarracenia (single arrows in Fig. 2B). The topology of
ANAL 11 diﬀers from ANAL 6 in the following aspects:
(i) evidence is found for a sister relationship between
Pentaphylacaceae and the other families with a primitive
wood structure in the Baileyan sense (ericoids–Theaceae–Symplocaceae–Styracaceae–Diapensiaceae) leading to a monophyletic clade IV (also found in the
original combined bootstrap topology), and (ii) several
large evolutionary lines are supported by higher bootstrap values (Fig. 3B).
The increase in resolution and bootstrap support at
higher taxonomic levels in the combined topologies of
ANAL 11 compared with the molecular analysis
(ANAL 6) can be compared with the improved resolution of the SEA Bayesian topology, which is based on
molecular data alone (Fig. 3). The positive eﬀect of this
combined analysis oﬀers new evidence to emphasize the
systematic importance of wood characters. Two examples can be cited, i.e., Actinidiaceae–Roridulaceae–
Sarraceniaceae (77 versus 70), and clade III (65 versus
57) (Fig. 3B). The former clade has already been well
established in various molecular studies (Morton et al.,
1997; Anderberg et al., 2002; Bremer et al., 2002;
Scho¨nenberger et al., 2005), while the latter clade
provides further evidence for the controversial taxonomic position of Sapotaceae, which is sometimes
linked to Lecythidaceae (Morton et al., 1997; Anderberg
et al., 2002). Another interesting relationship in the
combined bootstrap trees of ANAL 11 (and ANAL 8) is
that Pentaphylacaceae are sister to rest of clade IV.

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

Although this large clade has never been proposed
before in molecular analyses, this relationship makes
sense from a wood anatomical point of view: nearly all
its members are characterized by a unique primitive
syndrome of wood features in the Baileyan sense, which
is evident in all major cell types (Fig. 4). Moreover, the
presence of strong aluminum accumulators (Jansen
et al., 2004b) and the occurrence of more than two
fertile stamen whorls provides additional morphological
evidence for the inclusion of Pentaphylacaceae within
clade IV (Fig. 4; Caris, personal communication). It is
striking, but not uncommon in woody angiosperms, that
so-called primitive wood features are characteristic of
relatively derived APG clades at a high taxonomic level,
e.g., the asterid orders Aquifoliales (e.g., Baas, 1973),
Cornales (Noshiro and Baas, 1998) and Garryales
(Noshiro and Baas, 1998).
Other relationships in the combined analyses are
more ambiguous. As demonstrated in our study, the
position of Lecythidaceae remains problematic. Figures 2B and 3B provide evidence for a sister relationship between Lecythidaceae and Polemoniaceae–
Fouquieriaceae (clade II), an association that has never
been proposed before. However, removal of the ﬁve
continuous wood characters, or exclusion of the ﬁve
ecologically adaptive features, or a switch from the
ﬁve discrete ordered to unordered characters leads to
the disappearance of this clade in the strict consensus
trees. Despite the large diﬀerences in life form between
the three families, there are several wood characters
that support clade II, such as simple perforations (char.
2 state 2), relatively short vessel elements (char. 3 states
0–2), alternate intervessel pits (char. 5 state 4), banded
axial parenchyma (char. 13 state 1), and the presence of
prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma (char. 20 state 1;
absent in Polemoniaceae). Furthermore, Fouquieria and
Napoleonaea share vasicentric tracheids (char. 9 state
1), a feature that is scarce in other ericalean members,
except for Sapotaceae (Carlquist et al., 1984; de Zeeuw,
1990; Carlquist, 2001b; Kukachka, 1978–82; Lens
et al., in press). However, most of these characters are
common in clades I–III, and more morphological ⁄ molecular characters together with many more taxa
need to be studied before this relationship can be
further established. Symplocaceae is another family of
which the closest relatives remain unresolved. In the
molecular bootstrap analysis, the family is moderately
supported as sister to Styracaceae–Diapensiaceae, a
placement that agrees with ﬂower characters (Caris
et al., 2002; SEA). From a wood anatomical point of
view, Symplocaceae seem more closely related to
Theaceae due to the co-occurrence of solitary vessels,
and a distinctive combination of aluminum accumulation in the wood (char. 23 state 1; Jansen et al., 2004b)
and strongly reduced borders in the vessel-ray pits,
although also distinctly bordered vessel-ray pits are

243

present (char. 7 states 0–1; van den Oever et al., 1981;
Liang and Baas, 1990, 1991).
The strict consensus trees of the combined parsimony
analyses of the data sets without the continuous
characters (ANAL 9, 13) show similar but slightly less
resolved topologies compared with the total evidence
analyses (ANAL 8, 11). For instance, clade II disappears in ANAL 9 and 13, and the relationship between
Ebenaceae and primuloids collapses in ANAL 13.
Bootstrap topologies also remain similar, but, surprisingly, support values in ANAL 9 and 13 increase for
several clades compared with the total evidence analyses: clade II (65 versus 59) and clade III (66 versus 57)
receive higher support in ANAL 9, and Pentaphylacaceae (83 versus 76) and clade IV without Pentaphylacaceae (74 versus 67) shows higher support in ANAL 13.
Evolution of wood characters in Ericales
In order to trace the evolutionary patterns of the
wood structure in Ericales, selected wood characters
with potential systematic value are plotted on the
combined non-pedomorphic bootstrap topology
(Fig. 4). The fact that morphological data are plotted
on a tree that is partly based on the same features does
not necessarily assume circular reasoning. It is more
important that the characters included in the matrix are
all independent, and that they possess potential phylogenetic information (for a detailed discussion, see
Luckow and Bruneau, 1997). One must also take into
account that the phylogenetic trees only show the wood
diversity of the ericalean taxa included (55 versus 357).
For more details on the separate lineages, we refer to
wood anatomical papers in the list of references.
The so-called primitive wood structure in Cornales
(represented by Cornus and Hydrangea in the outgroup)
is nearly identical to the anatomy present in clade IV in
vessel (chars 2 state 0, 3 states 3–9, 4 states 0–4, 5 states
0–3, 8 state 1) and ﬁber morphology (char. 10 state 1),
axial parenchyma distribution (char. 13 state 0), and
uniseriate rays incidence (char. 14 state 0) (Fig. 4). As
the position of balsaminoids as sister to the other
ericalean lineages is strongly supported, the evolution
towards a ‘‘derived’’ wood structure must have occurred
at least twice depending on the ambiguous relationship
between clades II, III and IV. As mentioned before, the
adaptation of cornalean–ericalean ancestors from more
temperate and boreal ⁄ arctic regions into warm tropical
lowland forests is probably the driving force behind the
convergent evolution to so-called derived vessel elements (shorter and wider cells with simple perforations
and alternate pitting; chars 2 state 2, 3 states 0–2, 4
states 5–9, 5 state 4), ﬁbers with simple to minutely
bordered pits (char. 10 state 0), and banded or paratracheal parenchyma (char. 13 states 1–2) (Bailey and
Tupper, 1918; Kribs, 1937; Carlquist, 2001a).

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

The majority consensus trees of the molecular
(ANAL 6) and combined non-pedomorphic analyses
(ANAL 11) ﬁnd conﬂicting hypotheses for the ambiguous relationships between clades II, III and IV: ANAL
11 shows evidence for a sister relationship between
clades II and III (81%), but ANAL 6 ﬁnds much more
parsimonious trees in which clades III and IV are sisters
(77%). From a wood anatomical point of view, it is
most unlikely that there has been a massive reversal
from the derived to the primitive condition in the
common ancestor of clade IV, even if this massive
reversal would be a more or equally parsimonious way
to explain character evolution. Therefore, we favor the
retention hypothesis, in which we state that the so-called
primitive wood structure in clade IV is a retention of the
primitive anatomy present in Cornales. In this retention
scenario, the relationships proposed in the majority
consensus tree of ANAL 11 imply only two (instead of
three in ANAL 6) convergent evolutionary lines to the
derived condition: one to clade I, and one to the sister
clades II–III.
Evidence from fossils and DNA sequence data demonstrate that the diversiﬁcation into the two ericalean
wood types most likely has taken place relatively shortly
after the origin of Ericales, allowing most evolutionary
lines in clades I–III to develop distinct wood features
(Sytsma et al., 2006) (Fig. 4). For example, balsaminoids (clade I) and primuloids (clade III) can be
characterized by septate ﬁbers (char. 11 state 1), and
high multiseriate rays (char. 16 states 6–9) with heterocellular body ray cells (char. 17 state 1), but they clearly
diﬀer in the presence of mineral inclusions [raphides
(char. 19 state 1) versus prismatic crystals (char. 18 state
1) or silica bodies (char. 22 state 1)]. In addition, the
families Ebenaceae, Sapotaceae (both clade III) and
Lecythidaceae (clade II) share banded axial parenchyma
(char. 13 state 1), low (char. 16 states 0–1) and narrow
multiseriate rays (char. 15 states 0–2) with exclusively
procumbent body ray cells (char. 17 state 0), and
prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma (char. 20 state 1),
but they can be distinguished from each other based on
the presence of vasicentric tracheids (char. 9 state 1) and
crystal sand (both typical of Sapotaceae; char. 21 state
1), the presence of two types of vessel-ray pitting (unique
to Sapotaceae and Lecythidaceae; char. 7 state 2), and
the tendency to form opposite to alternate intervessel
pitting (Ebenaceae; char. 5 state 3) (Fig. 4). The wood
diversity within clade IV is much lower: only Theaceae
and many Symplocaceae can be distinguished anatomically from the other representatives by the occurrence
of vessel-ray pitting with much reduced borders (char. 7
state 1).
There are some exceptions to the characterization
of two major wood types at a lower taxonomic level,
which is caused by diﬀerences in habitat, life form
and secondary woodiness (Fig. 4). The impact of

diﬀerent habitats is clear in the typical tropical
lowland clades I–III: the common vessel type (relatively large diameter and predominantly simple perforations) is not present in the (sub)montane tropical
genera Impatiens, Lissocarpa, Norantea and Pentamerista, which is a conﬁrmation for the generally
accepted ecological trends in wood (e.g., Baas, 1976;
Carlquist, 2001a). Furthermore, the eﬀect of diﬀerences in life form may provide an explanation why
the vessel morphology between clades I–III and clade
IV diﬀers: relatively wide vessel elements (char. 4
states 5–9) with simple perforations (char. 2 state 2)
are common in clades I–III because of the abundance
of tall trees, while narrow vessels with scalariform
perforations are typical of clade IV in which shrubs
and small trees are dominant (e.g., Baas, 1976).
Genera that have an atypical life form compared with
the other members of the same clade often show
diﬀerences in vessel diameter and ⁄ or the type of
perforation (Fig. 4). For example, mixed scalariform ⁄ simple perforations (char. 2 state 1) occur
always in Napoleonaea (clade II), a typical member
of the understorey vegetation in tropical West Africa.
Also other Lecythidaceae that grow in the same
understorey vegetation type, such as Brazzeia, Pierrina and Rhaptopetalum, have the same mixed
perforation type (Carlquist, 1988; Lens et al., in
press). Other examples that illustrate the impact of
habit are relatively wide vessels in climbing Actinidia
species (clade IV; char. 4 state 7; Carlquist, 1989a)
and in tall trees of Bruinsmia (clade IV; char. 4 state
7; Dickison and Phend, 1985), while narrow vessels
are present in shrubs to small trees of Acanthogilia,
Cantua, Clavija, Fouquieria and Lysimachia (members
of clades I–III; char. 4 states 0–1; Carlquist et al.,
1984; Carlquist, 2001b; Lens et al., 2005a). The eﬀect
of secondary woodiness on the evolution of wood
characters in Ericales has already been discussed in
previous paragraphs. The genus that shows the most
pedomorphic characters is Impatiens (chars 3, 5–6, 12,
15–17). The fact that all pedomorphic taxa included
have narrow vessels (char. 4 states 0–2) is not
surprising because they are represented by small
‘‘woody herbs’’ or tiny shrubs. In the lianous genus
Cobaea (clade II), the pedomorphic impact blurs the
typical climbing anatomy, which is illustrated by
relatively narrow vessel elements and the absence of
rays (Carlquist et al., 1984; Carlquist, 1989a).

Conclusions
The wood structure of the highly diverse order
Ericales contains phylogenetically important information, despite homoplasious trends caused by ecological
adaptations, habit and secondary woodiness. Combined

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254

wood ⁄ molecular matrices, including < 1% wood anatomical characters and with pedomorphic character
states coded as inapplicable, lead to an improved
resolution and support of the bootstrap topology as
compared with the molecular analyses. Taxonomically
useful features are vessel grouping, vessel perforation
type, intervessel and vessel-ray pitting, axial parenchyma distribution, ﬁber type, frequency of uniseriate
rays, shape of body ray cells and type of mineral
inclusions. The wood anatomical diversity within Ericales can be divided into two wood types: (i) members
growing in tropical montane or more temperate to arctic
regions show a ‘‘primitive’’ type that probably has
evolved with little change from the more basal outgroup
Cornales, and (ii) tropical lowland taxa possess a
‘‘derived’’ type that has evolved at least twice in separate
evolutionary lines. We hope that this paper encourages
other wood anatomists ⁄ morphologists to carry out
combined cladistic analyses, even when the number of
morphological characters represents only a fraction of
the total amount of data.

The 23 features of the wood matrix are discussed below. The choice
of the characters and their states are based on the literature and on
personal observations using more than 500 wood samples (Lens, 2005).
1 Vessel grouping (Figs 4 and 5A–C): (0) solitary; (1) solitary and in
short radial multiples; (2) commonly in radial multiples. Typically
solitary vessels apply when more than 90% of the vessels are solitary.
This grouping characterizes ericoid taxa, Pentaphylacaceae, Symplocos, and Theaceae. In genera of Marcgraviaceae, primuloids and
Diospyros, about 50% of the vessels are solitary and the other part is
distributed in short radial multiples of two to four. Common radial
multiples occur when more than 75% of the vessels are found in
multiples of two to 10. This is observed in the genera Lissocarpa,
Pelliciera and Sladenia, and in most Sapotaceae included.
2 Vessel perforation (Figs 4 and 5D–F): (0) exclusively scalariform; (1)
mixed scalariform ⁄ simple; (2) predominantly simple. Exclusively
scalariform perforations occur in all genera of Clethraceae, Cyrillaceae, Pentaphylacaceae, Roridulaceae, Sarraceniaceae, Symplocaceae
and Theaceae, and most genera of Actinidiaceae and Styracaceae.
Some genera include a considerable number of species with mixed
simple and scalariform perforations, such as Actinidia, Empetrum,
Lissocarpa, Napoleonaea and Vaccinium. The genera that can be
deﬁned by simple vessel perforations may also have a very small
proportion of scalariform perforations, usually less than 5%. This is

observed in among others Impatiens, Marcgravia, Maesa and Pentamerista.
3 Mean vessel element length (coded with Thiele’s method; Fig. 4):
(0) 210–310 lm; (1) 340–500 lm; (2) 560–730 lm; (3) 770–945 lm;
(4) 1000–1150 lm; (5) 1165–1350 lm; (6) 1380–1600 lm; (9) 2120 lm.
Within Ericales, there are genera with long vessel elements (more than
1000 lm), e.g., Cyrilla, Symplocos, Tetramerista, and several genera of
Pentaphylacaceae and Theaceae, while other taxa can be deﬁned by
short vessel elements with a mean length of less than 300 lm (Cobaea,
Empetrum, Impatiens).
4 Mean tangential vessel diameter (coded with Thiele’s method):
(0) 20–25 lm; (1) 30–45 lm; (2) 50–65 lm; (3) 70–80 lm (4)
90–100 lm (5) 115–120 lm (6) 125 lm (7) 150–160 lm; (8) 180 lm;
(9) 190 lm. Vessel diameter shows a huge variation in Ericales: some
genera can be identiﬁed by relatively wide vessels, often more than
100 lm in tangential width (Actinidia, Couroupita, Ficalhoa, Madhuca,
Marcgravia, Norantea, Tetramerista), while other taxa characteristically have narrow vessel elements below 30 lm in width, such as
Empetrum and Sarracenia.
5 Intervessel pit arrangement (Figs 4 and 5G–I): (0) scalariform;
(1) scalariform to opposite; (2) opposite; (3) opposite to alternate;
(4) alternate. A constant incidence of exclusively scalariform intervessel pitting at the genus level is only found in few genera, e.g., Impatiens

Fig. 5. Wood photographs showing the distribution patterns of vessels (A–C, TS ¼ transverse section), the type of vessel perforation plates (D–F;
RLS ¼ radial longitudinal section), the arrangements of intervessel pitting (G–I; TLS ¼ tangential longitudinal section), and the type of vessel-ray
pitting (J–L; RLS). (A) Saurauia villosa. Solitary vessels. (B) Mimusops ebolowensis. Vessels solitary and in short radial multiples.
(C) Manilkara multinervis. Vessels commonly in radial multiples. (D) Ternstroemia japonica. Vessel perforations scalariform with many bars.
(E) Vaccinium calycinum. Perforations mixed scalariform and simple. (F) Chrysophyllum perpulchrum. Perforation plates exclusively simple.
(G) Ternstroemia japonica. Intervessel pitting scalariform to opposite. (H) Clethra lanata. Intervessel pitting opposite. (I) Scytopetalum tieghemii.
Intervessel pitting alternate. (J) Diospyros virginiana. Vessel-ray pitting distinctly bordered. (K) Symplocos guianensis. Vessel-ray pitting elongate
(scalariform) with much reduced borders. (L) Bertholletia excelsa. Two distinct types of vessel-ray pitting.

and Pentaphylax. A co-occurrence of scalariform and opposite
intervessel pitting is found in diﬀerent ericalean families, such as
Ericaceae, Symplocaceae, Pentaphylacaceae and Sarraceniaceae. In
contrast to Herendeen and Miller (2000), the intermediate character
state ‘‘opposite to alternate’’ is added, because this state is typical of
some genera, such as Enkianthus, Diospyros, Lissocarpa and Styrax.

Exclusively alternate intervessel pitting characterizes balsaminoids,
primuloids, Lecythidaceae, Polemoniaceae, Roridulaceae and Sapotaceae.
6 Mean intervessel pit diameter (coded with Thiele’s method):
(0) 4 lm; (1) 5 lm; (2) 6–7 lm; (3) ¼ 8 lm; (5) ¼ 10 lm; (7) ¼
12 lm; (8) ¼ 14 lm; (9) ¼ 15 lm. Many genera of Lecythidaceae and

F. Lens et al. / Cladistics 23 (2007) 229–254
Sapotaceae characteristically have large intervessel pits of more than
6 lm, whereas other taxa show intervessel pitting that is always smaller
than 6 lm (e.g., some ericoids). Genera in which opposite as well as
scalariform pitting is observed (e.g., Cyrilla and Symplocos), only
opposite pitting is taken into account in order to compare this with the
pit diameter of genera without scalariform intervessel pitting. In case
of exclusively scalariform pits in Impatiens and Pentaphylax, only the
smallest pits were measured.
7 Vessel-ray pitting (Figs 4 and 5J–L): (0) distinctly bordered; (1)
elongated with much reduced borders; (2) two distinct types. Most
Ericales show a vessel-ray pitting that is similar to intervessel pitting,
i.e., a comparable arrangement and distinct pit borders at the vessel
side. In some taxa, vessel-ray pitting is typically scalariform with
reduced borders, such as Pentaphylax, Theaceae and Symplocos
(although also distinctly bordered pits are present in the latter genus),
and many genera of the tribe Vaccinieae (Ericaceae). Most Lecythidaceae and Sapotaceae can be deﬁned by the presence of two distinct
types of vessel-ray pitting, i.e., ‘‘normal’’ alternate pits with distinct
borders that co-occur with elongated, irregularly shaped pits with
reduced borders. These two types may or may not be associated with
the same ray cell.
8 Helical thickenings: (0) absent; (1) present in vessels. This character
is only coded as present when it is clearly visible; grooves interconnecting pit apertures are not taken into account. Helical thickenings
are generally found in vessels of ericoids, Theaceae, Pentaphylacaceae
and Symplocaceae. Generally they are restricted to the tail of vessel
elements or around the inner pit apertures, but in some cases they are
clearly developed throughout the body of a vessel element.
9 Vasicentric tracheids (Fig. 4): (0) absent; (1) present. We consider
vasicentric tracheids to be long and narrow cells, with dense pitting in
both radial and tangential walls ( 15–50 pits per 100 lm of tracheid
length), that are closely associated with vessels. The abundant pits are
conspicuously bordered and form two or three longitudinal rows on
the radial and tangential walls. Vasicentric tracheids typically occur in
Sapotaceae, and are more scattered among other ericalean members,
such as Fouquieria, Napoleonaea and Vaccinium.
10 Fibers with conspicuously bordered pits (Figs 4 and 6A,B): (0)
absent; (1) present. Fibers with conspicuously bordered pits, often
called ﬁber-tracheids in literature, are usually longer than tracheids,
thin- or thick-walled, and contain a single row of distinctly bordered
pits on the tangential walls ( 5–15 pits per 100 lm of ﬁber-tracheid
length). The mean distance between two ﬁber-tracheid pits on the
tangential wall is longer than the distance between two tracheid pits,
although the pit borders usually do not diﬀer in size (often between 3
and 6 lm); the pit density in the radial walls is often higher. Fibertracheids are predominantly present in the genera of ericoids,
Pentaphylacaceae, Roridulaceae, Sarraceniaceae, Styracaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae. Some genera show ﬁbers with conspicuously
bordered pits as well as minutely bordered to even simple pits, such as
Diospyros and several Ericaceae genera (incl. Vaccinium), although

251

only one type clearly dominates. In these genera, only the abundant
type is coded as present.
11 Septate ﬁbers (Figs 4 and 6C): (0) absent; (1) present. Septa in
ﬁbers are often associated with ﬁbers having minutely bordered to
simple pits (Lecythidaceae, Marcgraviaceae, primuloids, Sapotaceae),
although some taxa possess septate ﬁber-tracheids (Marcgravia,
Norantea). Personal observations revealed the presence of septate
ﬁber-tracheids in Sarracenia, although this feature was overlooked by
DeBuhr (1977).
12 Fibers thick- to very thick-walled: (0) absent; (1) present. According to the IAWA list of microscopic features for hardwood identiﬁcation (IAWA Committee, 1989), the ﬁber lumina of (very) thickwalled ﬁbers are almost completely closed. This character is typical of
some genera like Camellia, Tetramerista, Ternstroemia, many Sapotaceae, and some genera of Ebenaceae and Lecythidaceae.
13 Axial parenchyma distribution (Figs 4 and 7A–C): (0) diﬀuse or
diﬀuse-in-aggregates; (1) in bands; (2) predominantly scanty or
vasicentric paratracheal. We have chosen not to divide this character
into three separate binary characters (for each of the three characters
only two states: absent and present), because of their dependency from
each other: most genera have just one type of axial parenchyma
distribution. The presence of few axial parenchyma cells lying next to
vessels (paratracheal parenchyma) is neglected when the abundant
parenchyma type is apotracheal (states 0 and 1), because of the
widespread occurrence of few paratracheal parenchyma cells in the
order. The states ‘‘diﬀuse’’ and ‘‘diﬀuse-in-aggregates’’ are combined
into one because of the continuous variation in several genera, for
instance Pentamerista and Vaccinium. This type of distribution is
observed in most genera of ericoids, Pentaphylacaceae, Theaceae,
Styracaceae and Symplocaceae. The so-called diﬀuse clusters type in
Fouquieria (. Carlquist, 2001b) is considered here as diﬀuse-inaggregates. Banded axial parenchyma is typical of Acanthogilia
(Polemoniaceae), Diospyros (Ebenaceae), Lissocarpa (Ebenaceae),
and Sapotaceae and Lecythidaceae. The scanty and vasicentric
parenchyma distribution is combined into one character because of
continuous variation in primuloids and Diospyros. Marcgraviaceae is
the only family in which vasicentric parenchyma is typical.
14 Uniseriate ray incidence (Figs 4 and 8A–C): (0) obviously present;
(1) scarce; (2) absent. In most Ericales, uniseriate rays are common,
but they are scarce in Fouquieria, Lissocarpa, Polemoniaceae and
Sapotaceae (less common than multiseriate rays, often between 0 and
2 ⁄ mm). Uniseriate rays are typically lacking in Impatiens, and in
genera of Myrsinaceae (except in Aegiceras) and Theophrastaceae.
15 Mean multiseriate ray width (number of cells, coded with Thiele’s
method): (0) 2; (1) 3–4 (2) 6; (3) 7; (4) 8; (6) 10; (9) 15. The width of
multiseriate rays shows much variation within Ericales, ranging from
very wide rays (up to 42-seriate in some species of Marcgravia) to
narrow two-seriate rays in many genera of Sapotaceae, Pelliciera and
Tetramerista. Taxa that lack multiseriate rays (Cobaea, Empetrum,
Lysimachia and Roridula) are coded as ‘‘–’’.

Fig. 8. Major types of ray characters as observed in tangential (A–C; TLS) and radial sections using LM observations (D–F; RLS).
(A) Jacquinia keyensis. Multiseriate rays wide and high, uniseriate rays absent. (B) Autranella congolensis. Multiseriate rays narrow and low,
uniseriate rays scarce (arrows). (C) Gaultheria sp. Uniseriate rays obviously present. (D) Clethra sp. Exclusively procumbent body ray cells.
(E) Tetramerista glabra. Mixture of procumbent, square and upright body ray cells. (F) Impatiens niamniamensis. Rays consisting of upright
cells only.
16 Mean multiseriate ray height (coded with Thiele’s method): (0) 350–
635 lm; (1) 765–1300 lm; (2) 1530– 2000 lm; (3) 2270–3000 lm; (4)
3500 lm; (6) 5000 lm; (9) 7000–7200 lm. The height of multiseriate
rays is measured on tangential longitudinal sections. Some Ericales
genera show multiseriate rays that are typically lower than 1 mm
(Cleyera, Cyrilla, Diospyros, Halesia, many Sapotaceae), and others
can be distinguished by very high multiseriate rays that sometimes
exceed 10 mm in length (Clavija, Impatiens, Marcgravia and Myrsine).
The absence of rays in some species of Impatiens is ignored, because
rays are present in other species. Genera that lack multiseriate rays
(Cobaea, Empetrum, Lysimachia and Roridula) are coded as ‘‘–’’.
17 Body ray cell shape in multiseriate rays (Figs 4 and 8D–F): (0)
exclusively procumbent; (1) mixture of procumbent, square and ⁄ or
upright marginal; (2) exclusively upright. Body ray cells are ray cells in
the multiseriate portion of a multiseriate ray. The majority of genera
has exclusively procumbent body ray cells, as seen in radial longitudinal sections. Heterocellular body ray cells are typical of balsaminoid
and primuloid taxa, and many species of the tribe Vaccinieae

(Ericaceae), while exclusively upright ray cells are present in Impatiens,
Heliamphora, Roridula and Sarracenia. Genera that lack multiseriate
rays (e.g., Cobaea, Empetrum, Lysimachia and Roridula) are coded as
‘‘–’’.
18 Prismatic crystals in rays (Fig. 9A): (0) absent; (1) present.
Prismatic crystals often occur in rays of Diospyros, Fouquieria,
Lecythidaceae and primuloids, and they are less frequently present in
Cyrilla, Ericaceae, Sapotaceae, Styracaceae and Symplocaceae. Genera
that lack rays (Cobaea, Empetrum, Lysimachia and Roridula) are coded
as ‘‘–’’.
19 Raphides (Figs 4 and 9B): (0) absent; (1) present. Raphides are
characteristically present in the rays of Marcgraviaceae and Tetrameristaceae, and in tyloses of Balsaminaceae, but they are also
sporadically found in axial parenchyma of Saurauia.
20 Prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma (Fig. 9C): (0) absent; (1)
present. This feature is typically present in Diospyros, Fouquieria,
Lecythidaceae, Sapotaceae, and Sladenia, but it is also observed in
some Ericaceae, Styracaceae, Symplocaceae and Theaceae.

rays. (B) Pelliciera rhizophorae (RLS). Raphide bundle in ray cell. (C) Bertholletia excelsa (TLS). Prismatic crystals in axial parenchyma.
(D) Sideroxylon puberulum (TLS). Crystal sand in an axial parenchyma cell. (E) Baillonella toxisperma (TLS). Silica grain in ray cell.

21 Crystal sand (Figs 4 and 9D): (0) absent; (1) present. This character
characterizes Sapotaceae within Ericales, although it is not observed in
all species.
22 Silica bodies (Fig. 9E): (0) absent; (1) present. Silica grains are
characteristic in rays of many Sapotaceae genera, and to a lesser extent
also in Diospyros, Pentaphylax, Styrax, and some Lecythidaceae. The
observations in Myrsinaceae and Symplocaceae by ter Welle (1976)
could not be corroborated by extensive family treatments of Lens et al.
(2005b) and van den Oever et al. (1981), respectively. Therefore, they
are considered absent in the data matrix. The presence of silica grains
in Pentaphylax was not mentioned by Carlquist (1984), but personal
observations revealed silica grains in ray cells.
23 Aluminum accumulation in wood (Fig. 4): (0) absent; (1) present.
Within Ericales, this feature is only present in wood of Theaceae and
Symplocaceae. Al accumulation is more common in leaves, but this is
not taken into account. Additional chrome azurol-S-tests were
performed to determine the presence Al accumulation in the wood
of Cornus and Hydrangea, but only Hydrangea tested positive.

Appendix 2
The wood samples studied are listed per family in the appendix with
reference to the origin, collector, and diameter of the wood sample.
‘‘Mature’’ means that the wood sample is derived from a mature stem,
primarily based on the divergence of the rays, although the exact
diameter could not be traced. Institutional wood collections used in
this study are abbreviated according to the Index Xylariorum (Stern,
1988) and Index Herbariorum (Holmgren et al., 1990). Voucher data

of ericalean groups that have already been published, i.e., balsaminoids, primuloids and Vaccinium (Lens et al., 2004b, 2005a,b), are
omitted in this list.
